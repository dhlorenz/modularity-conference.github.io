Support for the incremental design of aspects themselves has been neglected, 
even as the use of aspects in conjunction with underlying systems is gaining 
acceptance. The ways in which aspects can cooperate or interfere with each other 
need to be made explicit at the design level. An aspect architecture, a new 
software architecture viewtype, is proposed, and its general principles are 
explained. An instantiation for extending UML is described, where designs of 
aspects provide maximal flexibility, and a new concern diagram is provided to 
show how aspects can be combined to treat different concerns of a system. An 
example shows aspect architecture views of a digital sound recorder.<br>

An effective requirements engineering (RE) approach must harmonise the need to 
achieve separation of concerns with the need to satisfy broadly scoped 
requirements and constraints. Techniques such as use cases and viewpoints help 
achieve separation of stakeholders’ concerns but ensuring their consistency with 
global requirements and constraints is largely unsupported. In this paper we 
propose an approach to modularise and compose such crosscutting, aspectual 
requirements. The approach is based on separating the specification of aspectual 
requirements, non-aspectual requirements and composition rules in modules 
representing coherent abstractions and following well-defined templates. The 
composition rules employ informal, and often concern-specific, actions and 
operators to specify how an aspectual requirement influences or constrains the 
behaviour of a set of non-aspectual requirements. We argue that such 
modularisation makes it possible to establish early trade-offs between aspectual 
requirements hence providing support for negotiation and subsequent 
decision-making among stakeholders. At the same time early separation of 
crosscutting requirements facilitates determination of their mapping and 
influence on artefacts at later development stages. A realisation of the 
proposed approach, based on viewpoints and the eXtensible Markup Language (XML), 
supported by a tool called ARCaDe and a case study of a toll collection system 
is presented.<br>

In this paper we introduce a novel aspect oriented implementation language, 
called JAsCo. JAsCo is tailored for component based development and the Java 
Beans component model in particular. The JAsCo language introduces two concepts: 
aspect beans and connectors. An aspect bean describes behavior that interferes 
with the execution of a component by using a special kind of inner class, called 
a hook. The specification of a hook is context independent and therefore 
reusable. A connector on the other hand, is used for deploying one or more hooks 
within a specific context. To implement the JAsCo language, we propose a new 
“aspect-enabled’ component model, which contains build-in traps that enable to 
interfere with the normal execution of a component. The JAsCo component model is 
backward-compatible with the Java Beans component model. Furthermore, the JAsCo 
component model allows very flexible aspect application, adaptation and removal 
at run-time. The necessary tool support for the JAsCo approach has been 
implemented. In addition, we present a performance assessment of our current 
implementation.<br>

Aspects are a novel programming language feature, to express concerns in program 
design that crosscut traditional abstraction boundaries. The focus of this paper 
are dynamic aspects. Such aspects are specified as pointcut designators 
(patterns in the call stack), coupled with advice (code whose execution is 
triggered by the given pattern). We propose a more primitive syntax for pointcut 
designators, based on regular expressions. This primitive syntax facilitates a 
new static analysis that in turn enables a more efficient implementation of 
aspects.<br>

A Case for

We define a generic join point model for checking the Law of Demeter (LoD). Join 
points are trees, pointcuts are predicates over join points, and advice is 
checked statically similar to how declare warning is checked in AspectJ. We 
illustrate how a joint point form is mapped to the object and class forms of LoD, 
and provide an implementation in AspectJ. The implementation approximates LoD’s 
class form by dynamically checking a particular execution using only the join 
points’ static part. The paper proposes two ways to extend AspectJ to provide 
access to lexical join points directly. The first proposes statically executable 
advice and pointcuts in terms of lexical join points. The second proposes 
statically executable meta-advice over the exposed abstract syntax tree of the 
program and using Demeter style traversals to mirror AspectJ pointcuts.<br>

The FreeBSD operating system more than doubled in size between version 2 and 
version 4. Many changes to primary modularity are easy to spot at a high-level. 
For example, new device drivers account for 38% of the growth. Not surprisingly, 
changes to crosscutting concerns are more difficult to track. In order to better 
understand how an aspect-oriented implementation would have fared during this 
evolution, we introduced several aspects to version 2 code, and then rolled them 
forward into their subsequent incarnations in versions 3 and 4 respectively. 
This paper describes the impact evolution had on these concerns, and provides a 
comparative analysis of the changes required to evolve the tangled versus 
aspect-oriented implementations.<br>
Our results show that for the concerns we chose, the aspect-oriented 
implementation facilitated evolution in four key ways: (1) changes were better 
localized, (2) configurability was more explicit, (3) redundancy was reduced, 
and (4) extensibility aligned with an aspect was more modular. Additionally, we 
found that the aspect-oriented implementation had negligible impact on 
performance.<br>

A crosscut language is used to describe at which points an aspect crosscuts a 
program. An important issue is how these points can be captured using the 
crosscut language without introducing tight coupling between the aspect and the 
program. Such tight coupling harms the evolvability of the program and the 
reusability of the aspect. Current pattern-based capturing already offers a 
certain decoupling between aspects and the program but it may still suffer from 
what we call the arranged pattern problem. In this paper, we discuss this 
problem and present a logic-based crosscut language from which we distil what 
language features are beneficial to avoid this problem.<br>

We present aspect-oriented programming in Jiazzi. Jiazzi enhances Java with 
separately compiled, externally linked code modules called units. Units can act 
as effective ``aspect'' constructs with the ability to separate crosscutting 
concern code in a non-invasive and safe way. Unit linking provides a convenient 
way for programmers to explicitly control the inclusion and configuration of 
code that implements a concern, while separate compilation of units enhances the 
independent development and deployment of the concern. The expressiveness of 
concern separation is enhanced by units in two ways. First, classes can be made 
open to the addition of new behaviour, fields, and methods after they are 
initially defined, which enables the direct modularization of concerns whose 
code crosscut object boundaries. Second, the signatures of methods and classes 
can also be made open to refinement, which permits more aggressive 
modularization by isolating the naming and calling requirements of a concern 
implementation.<br>

Aspect-oriented software development allows the programmer to identify and treat 
separately concerns that, subsequently, can be woven to different target 
applications. For this, aspect-oriented languages like AspectJ and Hyper/J 
provide mechanisms for defining and composing such crosscutting concerns. An 
introduction is a mechanism for defining certain static crosscutting concerns, 
i.e., concerns that affect the type of the application they are woven to. This 
paper discusses the implementations of introductions in AspectJ and Hyper/J and 
reveals their limitations by presenting typical examples of static crosscutting 
code that cannot be handled adequately by them. To solve these deficiencies we 
will present the concept of parametric introduction, which are introductions 
that rely on parameters that are evaluated during weave-time.<br>

Join point interception (JPI), is considered an important cornerstone of 
aspect-oriented languages. However, we claim that JPI alone does not suffice for 
a modular structuring of aspects. We propose CAESAR, a model for aspect-oriented 
programming with a higher-level module concept on top of JPI, which enables 
reuse and componentization of aspects, allows us to use aspects polymorphically, 
and introduces a novel concept for dynamic aspect deployment.<br>

Recent developments in service architectures suggest that run-time adaptations 
could be implemented with dynamic AOP. In this paper we discuss application 
requirements on run-time AOP support and present a system that addresses these 
requirements. We provide basic support for weaving using the Just-In-Time 
compiler, while the AOP system is treated as an exchangeable module on top of 
the basic support. This approach allows us to provide low run-time overhead, AOP 
system flexibility, and secure weaving. We provide an extensive empirical 
evaluation and discuss the trade-offs resulting from using the JIT compiler and 
a modularized architecture.<br>

Given the high proportion of HTTP traffic in the Internet, Web caches are 
crucial to reduce user access time, network latency, and bandwidth consumption. 
Prefetching in a Web cache can further enhance these benefits. For the best 
performance, however, the prefetching policy must match user and Web application 
characteristics. Thus, new prefetching policies must be loaded dynamically as 
needs change. Most Web caches are large C programs, and thus adding one or more 
prefetching policies to an existing Web cache is a daunting task. The main 
problem is that prefetching concerns crosscut the cache structure. 
Aspect-oriented programming is a natural technique to address this issue. 
Nevertheless, existing approaches either do not provide dynamic weaving, incur a 
high overhead for invocation of dynamically loaded code, or do not target C 
applications. In this paper we present &#956;-Dyner, which addresses these issues. In 
particular, &#956;-Dyner provides a low overhead for aspect invocation, that meets 
the performance needs of Web caches.<br>

Persistence - the storage and retrieval of application data from secondary 
storage media - is often used as a classical example of a crosscutting concern. 
It is widely assumed that an application can be developed without taking 
persistence requirements into consideration and a persistence aspect plugged in 
at a later stage. However, there are no real world examples showing whether 
persistence can in fact be aspectised and, if so, can this be done in a manner 
that promotes reuse and is oblivious1 to the application. In this paper, we 
provide an insight into these issues drawing upon our experience with a 
classical database application: a bibliography system. We argue that it is 
possible to aspectise persistence in a highly reusable fashion, which can be 
developed into a general aspect-based persistence framework. Nevertheless, 
application developers can only be partially oblivious to the persistent nature 
of the data. This is because persistence has to be accounted for as an 
architectural decision during the design of data-consumer components. 
Furthermore, designers of such components also need to consider the declarative 
nature of retrieval mechanisms supported by most database systems. Similarly, 
deletion requires explicit attention during application design as mostly 
applications trigger such an operation.<br>

Middleware technologies such as Web Services, CORBA and DCOM have been very 
successful in solving distributed computing problems for a large family of 
application domains. As middleware systems are getting widely adopted and more 
functionally mature, it is also increasingly difficult for the architecture of 
middleware to achieve a high level of adaptability and configurability, due to 
the limitations of traditional software decomposition methods. Aspect oriented 
programming has brought us new design perspectives because it permits the 
superimpositions of multiple abstraction models on top of one another. It is a 
very powerful technique in separating and simplifying design concerns. In this 
paper, we first show that, through the quantification of aspects in the legacy 
implementations, the modularity of middleware architecture is greatly hindered 
by the ubiquitous existence of tangled logic. We then go one step further by 
factoring out a number of aspects identified in the mining work and 
re-implementing them as aspect programs. The aspect oriented re-factorization 
allows us to apply a set of software engineering metrics to quantify the changes 
of the re-factored system in both the structural complexity and the runtime 
performance. The aspect oriented re-factoring proves that the aspect oriented 
programming is capable of composing orthogonal design requirements. The final 
``woven'' system is able to correctly provide both the fundamental functionality 
and the “aspectized” functionality with negligible overhead and a leaner 
architecture. Further more, the configurability of middleware is dramatically 
increased because the “aspectized” features can be configured in and out during 
the compile-time.<br>

From the early days of object-oriented programming, the model-view-controller 
paradigm has been pursued for a clear design which separates different 
responsibilities within an interactive application. In contrast to its untyped 
implementation in Smalltalk, any implementation in a statically typed language 
involves certain trade-offs which either blur the clear structure, destroy the 
intended independence, or introduce undue administrative overhead. Each 
alternative creates a different caricature of the originally crisp architecture. 
The programming model Object Teams provides a new modeling unit called Team plus 
a number of binding mechanisms by which a Team and its contained roles can be 
bound to existing parts of an application. It turns out that these mechanisms 
fit nicely for implementing a clear model-view-controller design not only for 
single elements but also for complex structures of GUI elements plus their 
binding to complex model structures. We furthermore propose to use the 
model-view-controller paradigm as a benchmark for AOSD approaches, since it 
combines a set of typical problems concerning the separation and integration of 
concerns.<br>

There are two important points of view on inclusion or subtype polymorphism in 
object-oriented programs, namely polymorphic access and dynamic dispatch. These 
features are essential for object-oriented programming, and it is worthwhile to 
consider whether they are supported in aspect-oriented programming (AOP). In AOP, 
pieces of crosscutting behavior are extracted from the base code and localized 
in aspects, losing as a result their polymorphic capabilities while introducing 
new and unexplored issues. In this paper, we explore what kinds of polymorphism 
AOP languages should support, using AspectJ as the basis for the presentation. 
The results are not exclusive to AspectJ - aspectual polymorphism may make 
aspects in any comparable AOSD language more expressive and reusable across 
programs, while preserving safety.<br>

Aspect-oriented software design will need to support languages with first-class 
and higher-order procedures, such as Python, Perl, ML and Scheme. These language 
features present both challenges and benefits for aspects. On the one hand, they 
force the designer to carefully address issues of scope that do not arise in 
first-order languages. On the other hand, these distinctions of scope make it 
possible to define a much richer variety of policies than first-order aspect 
languages permit. In this paper, we describe the subtleties of pointcuts and 
advice for higher-order languages, particularly Scheme. We then resolve these 
subtleties by alluding to traditional notions of scope. In particular, 
programmers can now define both dynamic aspects traditional to AOP and static 
aspects that can capture common security-control paradigms. We also describe the 
implementation of this language as an extension to Scheme. By exploiting two 
novel features of our Scheme system - continuation marks and language-defining 
macros -the implementation is lightweight and integrates well into the 
programmer's toolkit.<br>

Strategic

Strategic programming is a generic programming idiom for processing compound 
data such as terms or object structures. At the heart of the approach is the 
separation of two concerns: basic data-processing computations vs. traversal 
schemes. Actual traversals are composed by passing the former as arguments to 
the latter. Traversal schemes can be defined by the strategic programmer using a 
combinator style that relies on primitives for layered traversal. In this paper, 
we take a look at strategic programming from an aspect-oriented programming 
perspective. Throughout the paper, we compare strategic programming with 
adaptive programming, which is a well-established aspectual approach to the 
traversal of object structures. We start from the observation that 
aspect-oriented programming terms, e.g., crosscutting, join point, and advice 
can be instantiated for aspectual traversal approaches.<br>

A development task related to a crosscutting concern is challenging because a 
developer can easily get lost when exploring scattered elements of code and the 
complex tangle of relationships between them. In this paper we present a source 
browsing tool that improves the developer's ability to work with crosscutting 
concerns by providing better support for exploring code. Our tool helps the 
developer to remain oriented while exploring and navigating across a code base. 
The cognitive burden placed on a developer is reduced by avoiding disorienting 
view switches and by providing an explicit representation of the exploration 
process in terms of exploration paths. While our tool is generally useful, good 
navigation support is particularly important when exploring crosscutting 
concerns.<br>

Aspect-oriented software development (AOSD) has primarily focused on linguistic 
and meta-linguistic mechanisms for separating concerns in program source. 
However, the kinds of concern separation and complexity management that AOSD 
endeavors to achieve are not the exclusive province of programming language 
design. In this paper, we propose a new model of concern separation called 
visual separation of concerns (VSC) which is based on a new model of program 
storage. By altering the mechanisms used to store and manipulate program 
artifacts, much of the capability of concern separation can be captured without 
performing any linguistic transformations. We also describe our implementation 
of VSC, which is based on Stellation, an experimental software configuration 
management system. The VSC approach combined with software configuration 
management can have advantages over conventional approaches by avoiding program 
transformations, by providing persistent storage of features such as concern 
maps, and by enabling new techniques for concern identification and 
manipulation.<br>
