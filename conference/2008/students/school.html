<p>
The AOSD Spring School series provide a forum where we accompany you for a little while on the journey that is to be your thesis. At this highly interactive event, you will have the opportunity to discuss your work in the area of AOSD with experts and other students. The Spring School takes place on the Sunday preceding the conference so that you can still attend the workshops, tutorials and technical track. The Spring School is also a great opportunity to hook up with fellow students - especially for those students who are new to the community - before the conference starts. Also, you will get the undivided attention of some of AOSD's top researchers and industrials.</p>


<p>
The main goal of the AOSD Spring School is to promote a collaborative environment where questions, worries, pitfalls and other important issues can be identified and addressed:
</p>
<ul><li><strong>Experts</strong> in the field of AOSD and beyond will be invited again this year to help you address those issues.</li>
<li><strong>Allumni</strong> from previous Student Extravaganza's who have graduated will be there to share their experiences with you.</li>
<li><strong>You</strong> will be given the opportunity to express yourself and your research.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this last activity we will give you the opportunity to work on a manifestation of your work or vision in any medium you choose - poster, demo, pictures, artwork, poem, music, film, ... We will provide you with the items you need to create this manifestation (within reasonable means of course). The results will be exhibited during the Poster Event.
</p>

<h2>Important Note</h2>
<p>Daylight savings in Brussels the night before Spring School. Please adjust your clocks accordingly.</p>


<h2>Submission Guidelines
</h2>
<p>If you are a student working on a thesis or a major project in AOSD, we would like to encourage you to participate in the AOSD.08 Spring School. Everyone's welcome!
</p>
<p>In order to be one of the participants, please send us an email containing the following items, anytime between January 14 and March 3, 2008:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Affiliation</li>
    <li>Title of your work</li>
    <li>Areas of interest</li>
    <li>Keywords</li>
    <li>Your research hypothesis (max 200 words)<br/>
    (Note that for beginning researchers it can be difficult to formulate the research hypothesis. 
		In this case, try at least to formulate the problem you are going to address. For students nearing 
		the deadline of their thesis this should be a very precise and concrete statement)</li>
    <li>A list of the contributions you (expect to) make</li>
    <li> Your three (or more) main important question, worries, pitfalls, ... Some examples that were 
		collected during the 2006 Spring School can be found <a href="http://aosd.net/wiki/index.php?title=Spring_School">here</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>We welcome combined submissions for both the Spring School and the Poster Event. Note that the first 6 items that are required for the Spring School are the same as for the Poster Event, so they only have to be submitted once in a combined submission.</p>
<p>
Please send your submission to the organizers, Yvonne Coady and Maja D'Hondt, at extravaganza<img class="email" src="../img/z.gif" alt="@" />aosd.net.
