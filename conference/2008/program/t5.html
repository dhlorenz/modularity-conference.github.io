<h1>T5: Applying Aspectual Components to Eclipse with ObjectTeams/ Java and OSGi</h1>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday, April 1, 2008 (afternoon)</p>
<p><strong>Presenters:</strong><br />
Stephan Herrmann, <em>Technische Universit채t Berlin</em><br />
Marco Mosconi, <em>Technische Universit채t Berlin</em></p>

<p><strong>Level:</strong> Intermediate</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> To follow the hands-on examples (optional), a computer
with Java 5 or higher is required. The Object Teams Development Tooling
(OTDT) can be pre-loaded from www.objectteams.org but will also be
handed out on CD.
</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>OSGi and its Eclipse implementation Equinox are increasingly popular in
different fields like server-side, RCP, mobile and IDEs. Eclipse plugins
support anticipated variations through extension points, but not all
desired extensions can be known in advance. As a result, extending
existing plugins often requires manual intervention and copy&paste
reuse. Thus reuse, modularity, flexibility and maintainability cannot be
fully reconciled using existing technologies in isolation.</p>

<p>OT/Equinox integrates the aspect-oriented and role-based language
ObjectTeams/Java (OT/J) with OSGi and the Eclipse Plugin environment.
With OT/Equinox it is possible to implement Aspectual Components that
non-invasively adapt other plugins while preserving a component-based
architecture. This tutorial is split into two parts, the first part
presenting concepts and technology and the second part focusing on
methodology and application.</p>

<p>The first half of the tutorial introduces ObjectTeams/Java as a mature
aspect-oriented, role-based extension of Java as well as OSGi and
Equinox. Furthermore OT/Equinox is presented, which integrates the
language OT/J with the component framework Equinox in order to support
well structured architectures following the idea of Aspectual Components.</p>

<p>The second half showcases the self-application of OT/J and OT/Equinox in
the development of the Eclipse-based Object Teams Development Tooling
(OTDT), which is used as a real-world example throughout this tutorial.
Typical solutions in the development of Eclipse-based tooling are
presented, ranging from adaptations of the JDT compiler and UI to
modeling frameworks like GMF. We present the corresponding extension and
integration architectures as well as their realization with OT/Equinox
for selected components.
</p>
<h2>Biographies</h2>

<p>Dr. Stephan Herrmann is an Assistant Professor at the Technische
Universit채t Berlin. In 2001 he initiated the development of
ObjectTeams/Java. Between 2003 and 2006 he was the leader of the joint
research project TOPPrax (3 research institutes, 2 companies), a
publicly funded project for the evaluation of aspect oriented software
development in practical application. In 2006/07 Stephan Herrmann
developed the integration of OT/J with the Equinox component framework,
and applied this technology for improving the OTDT itself in terms of
completeness and maintainability. He has been teaching ObjectTeams/Java
in several classes since 2003 and in tutorials at Net.ObjectDays'05 and
AOSD'06.
</p>
<p>Marco Mosconi received his diploma in 2003. Since then he is a PhD
student working as research and teaching assistant at Technische
Universit채t Berlin. His research includes the combination of
model-driven and aspect-oriented software development approaches. He
also has a strong focus on component-oriented target platforms and did
already work on the integration of aspect-oriented concepts and
component models as part of his diploma thesis. Marco Mosconi has been
involved in teaching several software engineering courses and projects
since 2003 on a regular basis.</p>
