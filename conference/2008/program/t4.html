<h1>T4 : Aspect-Oriented Requirements Engineering With Scenarios</h1>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday, April 1, 2008 (morning)</p>
<p>
<strong>Presenters:</strong> Gunter Mussbacher, Joao Araujo, Ana Moreira, Jon Whittle</p>
<p><strong>Level:</strong> Intermediate</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Participants are assumed to have some general experience
in scenario-based system modeling and general knowledge of software and
requirements engineering. Knowledge of aspect-oriented requirements
engineering is not necessary as we will introduce the essential concepts
in the area.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>


<p>Requirements that cut across other requirements may result in tangled
representations. This makes changing requirements more difficult as the
impact of changes is more complicated and costly to manage. A means of
modeling crosscutting concerns (aspects) at the requirements stage
independently and also a means of composing aspects with other
requirements in a way that will allow the entire set of requirements to
be validated are necessary to cope with inevitably changing
requirements. In this tutorial, we consider aspects at the requirements
level, concentrating on scenario-based requirements. We present in
detail two techniques for specifying and composing aspect-oriented
scenarios: Modeling Aspects Using a Transformational Approach (MATA) and
Aspect-oriented Use Case Maps (AoUCM).</p>

<p>Among other applications, we can use scenario-based aspect-oriented
requirements engineering (SBAORE) to model volatile requirements. A
rapidly changing market leads to software systems with highly volatile
requirements. These must be managed in a way that reduces the time and
costs associated with updating a system to meet these new requirements.
By externalizing such volatile concerns with aspect-oriented techniques,
we can build a stepping-stone for future management of unanticipated
requirements change.</p>

<p>At the end of the tutorial, participants will understand</p>
<ul>
<li>the usefulness of SBAORE for addressing crosscutting requirements to
improve modularity and evolvability of RE models;</li>

<li>how to use general good practice guidelines and MATA and AoUCM to
identify, modularize, and compose aspects in scenario-based requirements;</li>

<li>how to identify and deal with volatile requirements using SBAORE; and</li>

<li>a set of composition techniques for SBAORE.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Biographies</h2>

<p>Dr. João Araújo holds a PhD in Computer Science from Lancaster
University, UK, in the area of Requirements Engineering. Currently, his
main research interest is in aspect-oriented requirements engineering.
He has been a co-organizer of Early Aspects workshops since 2002.
Additionally, he has served on the organization committees as Tutorials
and Publicity Chair of ACM/IEEE MoDELS conferences. Also, he organized a
panel on AOSD and Model-Driven Development at MoDELS’07. Currently, he
is a Co-Publicity chair of the 16th IEEE Requirements Engineering
Conference and a guest editor of the Special Issue on Early Aspects at
the Transaction on AOSD journal.</p>

<p>Dr. Ana Moreira is an Associate Professor in the Computing Science
Department at Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal. Her main research
areas are aspect-oriented requirements engineering and architecture with
a current focus on aspect-orientation and Software Product Lines. She
serves on the editorial board of the TAOSD and "Software and Systems
Modeling" journals. She has been involved, both as organiser and
programme committee member, in several conferences, such as ECOOP,
CAiSE, UML, and is currently on the MODELS and AOSD Steering Committees
and the AOSD 2009 Program Committee Chair. She has co-organised the
various editions of the Early Aspects workshop.</p>

<p>Gunter Mussbacher received a M.Sc. in the area of requirements
engineering from Simon Fraser University, Canada, where he has also
taught software engineering courses. While working as a research
engineer for Mitel Networks, he applied and taught URN concepts and
participated in the URN standardization effort of ITU-T (the first
standardization effort combining goal-oriented and scenario-based
requirements in one language). He has taught URN tutorials at several
conferences and is a co-organizer for the Early Aspects Workshop at AOSD
2008. For his PhD studies at the University of Ottawa, he is focusing on
aspect-oriented requirements engineering, patterns, and URN.</p>

<p>Dr. Jon Whittle is a Professor of Software Engineering at Lancaster
University, UK. He is holder of a Royal Society Wolfson Merit Award. He
serves on the Editorial Board of the "Software and Systems Modeling"
journal and is Steering Committee Chair of MODELS. He has received the
IEE Proceedings Software Premium Award and Best Paper awards at the
World Congress on Software Quality 2005 and the Use Case Modeling
Workshop at MODELS 2005. He was UML2003 Conference Chair and UML2002
Tutorials/Workshops Chair. He has also co-organised several workshops at
conferences such as ICSE, MODELS, UML, ETAPS, ECOOP, and OOPSLA.</p>
