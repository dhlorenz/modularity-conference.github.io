<h2>The 4th AOSD Workshop on Aspects, Components, and Patterns for
Infrastructure Software (ACP4IS)</h2>

The workshop will be structured to encourage fruitful discussions and build connections between workshop participants.
To this end, approximately half of the workshop time will be devoted to short presentations of accepted papers,
with the remaining half devoted to semi-structured discussion groups. To help ensure focused discussions, participants
will be expected to read accepted papers and submit written comments on some of those papers prior to the workshop.
Participants will work with the workshop organizers prior to the workshop to establish topics for discussion groups.
