@<h2>The 4th AOSD Workshop on Aspects, Components, and Patterns for
Infrastructure Software (ACP4IS)</h2>

<a href="http://www.cs.uvic.ca/~ycoady/">Yvonne Coady</a></font> is an Assistant
Professor of Computer Science at the University of Victoria.  She has a
Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science at the University of British
Columbia, where she was advised by Gregor Kiczales.  Her Ph.D. research focused
on the implementation of aspects within operating systems.  To support this
research, Yvonne is one of the primary developers of AspectC, a language and
compiler based on the well-known AspectJ language.  Previously, Yvonne did work
in other areas of systems development, including adaptive concurrency control
mechanisms and the implementation of global memory management in workstation
clusters.  Yvonne taught Computer Science full time in a small college for
seven years before starting her Ph.D.  Yvonne is a member of the AOSD.05
program committee.

<a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~eeide/">Eric Eide</a></font> is a research staff
member with the Flux Research Group in the University of Utah School of
Computing.  Eric's current research is focused on tools and techniques for
integrated component-based and aspect-oriented programming of operating systems
and middleware.  The Flux Group's component tools include Knit, a component
definition and linking language for C code, and Jiazzi, a similar language for
Java.  Previously, Eric was the primary implementor of Flick, a flexible and
optimizing IDL compiler that was used to produce CORBA-based stubs for use
within a research operating system.  Eric has worked with the Flux Group for
over eight years and holds a MS degree in CS.  Eric was a program committee
member for AOSD 2002, the Tutorials Chair for AOSD 2003, and a Workshops and
Tutorials Co-Chair for AOSD 2004.  Now, he is the Publicity Chair for AOSD.05.

<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lorenz/">David H. Lorenz</a></font> is an
Assistant Professor of Computer and Information Science at Northeastern
University.  He has a Ph.D. from the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology.
Prof. Lorenz's research interests include concepts of software components, with
special interest in adaptive components and component-based design
(particularly JavaBeans technology).  He teaches courses in Programming
Languages, Object-Oriented Design, and Component-Based Programming.  He has
served on the program committees of International Technology of Object-Oriented
Languages and Systems Europe Conferences (TOOLS Europe 2000: Enterprise
Architecture, Patterns, Components; and TOOLS Europe 2001: Components for
Mobile Computing).  David was a co-chair of the OOPSLA '01 Workshop on Language
Mechanisms for Programming Software Components, and is a member of the
organizing committee (Posters and Demonstrations Co-Chair) for ECOOP '03.  He
is a member of editorial board of International Journal of Information
Technology and Decision Making, World Scientific Publishing Co.  David was a
member of the AOSD 2004 program committee, and is on the program committee for
FOAL '05.

<a href="http://www4.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~os/">Olaf Spinczyk</a> is an
Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the Friedrich-Alexander University
Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany.  He received his Ph.D. from the University of
Magdeburg, Germany, in 2002 for his research on "Operating System Construction
by Aspect-Orientation."  An important part of this work was the design of the
AspectC++ language, which he started in 2001.  AspectC++ is an aspect-oriented
language extension for C++.  Olaf demonstrated his AspectC++ compiler and its
suitability for embedded systems software construction at the AOSD 2003, OOPSLA
2003, and OOSPLA 2004 conferences.  He gave a tutorial on AOP with C++ at AOSD
2004 and organized the ECOOP 2002 workshop on Object-Orientation and Operating
Systems as well as the ECOOP 2004 workshop on Programming Languages and
Operating Systems.  His current research is focused on the combination of
Generic and Generative Programming with AOP in AspectC++, and on applying these
techniques in the implementation of the research operating system family CiAO.@
