<h2>The 4th AOSD Workshop on Aspects, Components, and Patterns for
Infrastructure Software (ACP4IS)</h2>

<h4>Call for papers <a href=cfp.pdf>(pdf)</a></h4>

The importance of "systems infrastructure" software -- including application servers, virtual machines, middleware,
compilers, and operating systems -- is increasing as application programmers demand better and higher-level support
for software development. Vendors that provide superior support for application development have a competitive
advantage. The software industry as a whole benefits as the base level of abstraction increases, thus decreasing the
need for application programmers to continually "reinvent the wheel."
<br><br>
These trends, however, mean that the demands on infrastructure software are increasing. More and more features
and requirements are being "pushed down" into the infrastructure, and the developers of systems software need better
tools and techniques for handling these increased demands. In particular, developers need better techniques for
modularizing, combining, and analyzing the many features that are now being demanded from infrastructure software.
<br><br>
This meeting of the ACP4IS workshop will focus on the particular topic of <b>implementing infrastructure software
product families</b>. A software product family is a group of systems, designed around a shared set of features and implemented
using a common set of parts. Each member of a family is implemented as a unique assembly or configuration
of parts; as a result, different family members have different feature sets. Aspects, components, and patterns have all
been used to implement software product families. The goal of this year's workshop is to better understand how these
techniques relate, individually and in combination, to the inherent challenges of systems infrastructure product families.
Critical issues include untangling the inherent complexity of infrastructure software; obtaining strong assurances
of correct and predictable behavior; achieving maximum run-time performance; and dealing with the large body of
existing systems software components. Suggested topics for position papers include, but are not restricted to:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Feature-oriented design and implementation of infrastructure software
<li> Relationships between features and aspects
<li> Novel approaches for dealing with conflicting features
<li> Support for fine-grain trade-offs between features
<li> Advances in representing, managing, and modularizing emergent system properties
<li> Application- or domain-specific optimization of systems
<li> Software product lines for resource-constrained and embedded systems
<li> Testing and validation across members of a systems product family
<li> Issues in systems that support dynamic feature selection
<li> Techniques for particular concerns in infrastructure product families, e.g., security and real-time
<li> Methods and tools for aspect-oriented product family design and implementation
<li> Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of product families
</ul>
