<h3><a name="cfp"></a>Call For Papers</h3>
<p>Aspect-oriented programming, component models, and design patterns are modern
and actively evolving techniques to improving the modularization of complex
software. In particular, these techniques hold great promise for the development
of ``systems infrastructure'' software, e.g., application servers, middleware,
virtual machines, compilers, operating systems, and other software that provides
general services for higher-level applications. The developers of infrastructure
software are currently faced with increasing demands from application
programmers needing higher-level support for application development. Meeting
these demands requires careful use of software modularization techniques, since
infrastructural concerns are notoriously hard to modularize.</p>
<p>Aspects, components, and patterns provide very different means to deal with
infrastructure software, but despite their differences, they have much in common.
For instance, component models try to free the developer from the need to deal
directly with services like security or transactions. These are primary examples
of crosscutting concerns, and modularizing such concerns are the main target of
aspect-oriented languages. Similarly, design patterns like Visitor and
Interceptor facilitate the clean modularization of otherwise tangled concerns.</p>
<p>This workshop aims to provide a highly interactive forum for researchers and
developers to discuss the application of and relationships between aspects,
components, and patterns within modern infrastructure software. The goal is to
put aspects, components, and patterns into a common reference frame and to build
connections between the software engineering and systems communities. Suggested
topics for position papers include, but are not restricted to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Approaches that combine or relate component-, pattern-, and aspect-based&nbsp;
    techniques</li>
  <li>Dimensions of infrastructure software quality including comprehensibility,
    configurability (by implementors), customizability (by users), reliability,
    evolvability, scalability, and run-time characteristics such as performance
    and code size</li>
  <li>Merits and downsides of container-, ORB-, and system-based separation of
    concerns</li>
  <li>Architectural techniques for particular system concerns e.g., security,
    static and dynamic optimization, and real-time</li>
  <li>Design patterns for systems software</li>
  <li>Component, pattern, and aspect ``mining'' within systems code</li>
  <li>Application- or domain-specific optimization of systems</li>
  <li>Reasoning and optimization across architecture layers</li>
  <li>Quantitative and qualitative evaluations</li>
</ul>
<h3><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><a name="agenda"></a>Agenda<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">&nbsp;Our
goal is to have fruitful discussions. Each of the papers chosen for presentation will have
two assigned commentators from the program committee that will be responsible for triggering
the discussion after the presentation by shortly summarizing what they like and
dislike about the paper and to make very detailed comments on the paper. The
underlying idea is to help people improve their papers and ideas via the
discussion with the others and on the other side to give a broader audience a
better understanding of the ideas in the paper. Each presentation will have 5 -
20 min, depending on the content and the quality of the paper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is a little bit in the vein of ``writers workshops&quot; as for
example successfully applied at EuroPlop conferences. If necessary, we will
split in groups based on the topics of interest in order to have parallel
presentations.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">&nbsp;The
last session of the workshop will be 1 hour relaxed coffee time where people
should form groups of two or three based on their interests to discuss about
topics they find interesting. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><a name="guidelines"></a>Submission Guidelines<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">Position papers should be
3-6 pages. All papers must be submitted electronically in PDF, Postscript or MS
Word format. The papers should be emailed to: <a href="mailto:aosd-submit@ccs.neu.edu">aosd-submit@ccs.neu.edu</a>.
Paper submissions will be reviewed by the program committee using criteria
appropriate to their category. The submitted papers will be evaluated based on
their originality, relevance, technical quality and presentation. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p>All accepted papers will be posted at this workshop website prior to the
workshop date to give all participants the opportunity to read them before the
workshop. In addition, the accepted papers will be published in a Workshop
Proceedings as a University of British Columbia technical report.</p>
