Gastown is rich with history and culture as there are many
outstanding art galleries, antique shops, and native art stores,
along with countless excellent restaurants. Return here at night for
some fantastic nightclubs, pubs and live music. Also, you can
pick up great gifts and souvenirs in the many specialty shops.
