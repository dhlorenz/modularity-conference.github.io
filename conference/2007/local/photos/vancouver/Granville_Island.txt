Stop at Granville Island and marvel at the selection of fresh
fruits, vegetables, meats, cheeses, pastries, breads and gourmet
fare at the Public Market. Shop for unique souvenirs like handmade
paper or glass beads. Grab a snack from inside the market and sit on
the dock, feed the seagulls or watch any number of street
performers&mdash;from musicians to magicians.
