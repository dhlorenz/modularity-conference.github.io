A perfect place to hold hands, saunter through wooded trails and
admire spectacular views of the Pacific. Seventy-five hectares of
virgin temperate rainforest, Lighthouse Park is home to some of the
largest Douglas Firs in Vancouver. Numerous, well marked trails to
explore - take an hour to explore or bring lunch and make it a full
afternoon!
