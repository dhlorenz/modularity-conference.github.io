No visit to Vancouver would be complete without a walk around the
Stanley Park seawall - all 10 kilometers that circle the entire
park. It offers spectacular views of the North Shore mountains,
Lions Gate Bridge, and there are many more places to stop and enjoy
the scenery or to picnic on the beachside.
