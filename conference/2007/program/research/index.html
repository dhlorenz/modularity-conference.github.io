Achieving sufficient execution performance is a challenging goal of
software development.  Unfortunately, violating performance
requirements is often revealed at a late stage of the development.
Fixing a performance problem at such a late stage is difficult in
terms of cost and time.  To solve this problem, this paper presents
QoSWeaver, which provides aspect-oriented application-level
scheduling.  QoSWeaver weaves scheduling code written in an aspect
into application code.  The scheduling code gets an application thread
to voluntarily yield its execution to implement a scheduling policy.
The idea of scheduling at the application level is not new, but
aspect-oriented programming makes it more realistic by separation of
scheduling code.  QoSWeaver also provides a profile-based pointcut
generator, which automatically generates pointcuts for fine-grained
scheduling.  To investigate the ability of QoSWeaver for implementing
practical scheduling policies, we used QoSWeaver for tuning the
performance of a river monitoring system named Kasendas.  For reliable
examination, Kasendas was originally developed by an outside
corporation and then it was tuned by the authors with QoSWeaver.  The
authors could successfully improve the performance of Kasendas under
heavy workload and the work of the performance tuning was not large.

Object-oriented frameworks play an important role in different kinds of
software, such as product-lines, middleware, GUI components, IDEs, etc. Over
the past recent years, fundamentals of framework design stabilized around the
adoption of design patterns. However, major difficulties concerning framework
learning and usage are still evident, and constitute a burden for those who
have to deal with it. This paper proposes an approach that aims to facilitate
framework usage, based on the concept of specialization aspect. We show how
framework hot-spots can be modularized in terms of specialization aspects, and
how these can give support for specializing a framework in a step-wise way.
The approach is conservative, in the sense that specialization aspects can be
developed for an existing framework "as is". In order to support these claims,
a case study has been carried out by applying the technique on the JHotDraw
graphical framework.

The layered architecture of middleware platforms  (such as CORBA, SOAP,
J2EE) is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, layers provide services such as
demarshaling, session management,  request despatching, quality-of-service
(QoS) etc. In a typical middleware platform, every request passes through
each layer, whether or not the services provided by that layer are needed
for that specific request. This rigid layer processing can lower overall
system throughput, and reduce availability and/or increase vulnerability to
denial-of-service attacks.  For use cases where the response is a simple
function of the request input parameters, bypassing middleware layers may
be permissible and highly advantageous.  Unfortunately, if an application
developer desires to  selectively bypass the middleware, and process some
requests in the lower layer, she has to  write platform-specific, intricate
low-level  code.  To evade this trap,  we propose to extend the middleware
platform with new aspect-oriented modeling syntax, code generation tools,
and a development process for building bypassing implementations. Bypassing
implementations provide better use of server&acute;s resources, leading to better
overall client experience.  Our core contribution is this idea:
aspect-oriented extensions to IDL, additional code generation, along with
an enhanced run-time, can enable application developers to conveniently
bypass middleware layers when they are not needed, thus improving the
server&acute;s performance and providing more &ldquo;operational headroom&rdquo;.</p>

In this paper, we discuss the limitations of the current syntactic composition
mechanisms in aspect-oriented requirements engineering (AORE). We highlight
that such composition mechanisms not only increase coupling between aspects
and base concerns but are also insufficient to capture the intentionality of
the aspect composition. Furthermore, they force the requirements engineer to
reason about semantic influences and trade-offs among aspects from a syntactic
perspective. We present a requirements description language (RDL) that
enriches the existing natural language requirements specification with
semantic information derived from the semantics of the natural language
itself. Composition specifications are written based on these semantics rather
than requirements syntax hence providing improved means for expressing the
intentionality of the composition, in turn facilitating semantics-based
reasoning about aspect influences and trade-offs. We also discuss the
practicality of the use of this RDL by outlining the automation support for
requirements annotation (realized as an extension of the Wmatrix natural
language processing tool suite) to expose the semantics which are in turn
utilized to facilitate composition and analysis (supported by the MRAT tool).

Join Point Designation Diagrams (JPDDs) permit developers to design
aspect-oriented software on an abstract level. Consequently, JPDDs permit
developers to communicate their software design independent of the programming
language in use. However, developer face two problems. First, they need to
understand the semantics of JPDDs in addition to their programming language.
Second, after designing aspects using JPDDs they need to decide how to map
them into their programming language. A tool-supported translation of JPDDs
into a known aspect-oriented language obviously would ease both problems.
However, in order to translate a JPDD it is also necessary to determine what a
good translation is, i.e. it is necessary to have a number of principles that
determine what a good translation is. This paper describes a tool-supported
translation of JPDDs to aspect-oriented languages. Principles for translating
JPDDs are described and a concrete mapping to the aspect-oriented language
AspectJ is explained.

Design rules express constraints on the behavior and structure of a
program. These rules can help ensure that a program follows a set of
established practices, and avoids certain classes of errors.
</p>
<p>
Design rules often crosscut program structure and enforcing them is
emerging as an important application domain for Aspect Oriented
Programming. For many interesting design rules, current general
purpose AOP languages lack the expressiveness to characterize them
statically and enforce them at compile time.
</p>
<p>
We have developed a domain specific language called Program
Description Logic (PDL). PDL allows succinct declarative definitions
of programmatic structures which correspond to design rule
violations. PDL is based on a fully static and expressive pointcut
language. PDL pointcuts allow characterizing a wide range of design
rules without sacrificing static verification.
</p>
<p>
We evaluate PDL by comparing it to FxCop, an industrial strength tool
for checking design rules.

Most approaches to programming language extensibility have worked by pairing 
syntactic extension with semantic extension. We present an 
approach that works through a combination of presentation extension and 
semantic extension.  We also present an architecture for this approach, an 
Eclipse-based implementation targeting the Java programming language, and 
examples that show how presentation extension, both with and 
without semantic extension, can make programs more expressive.

The goal of this paper is to model and detect composition conflicts related to
introductions. Within this context, we identify several categories of
composition conflicts. To analyze the causes of these conflicts precisely, we
first model the structure of programs as graphs. Next, we model introductions
as graph transformation rules. We define explicit rules to describe when
composition conflicts related to introductions occur. We built a prototype
tool that detects and visualizes the occurrence of such conflicts in AspectJ
programs, making use of an existing graph analysis and rewriting tool. The
graph-based models are generated automatically from the source code of Java
programs and AspectJ introductions. However, our approach does not make strong
assumptions about either the aspect or base language; it has been designed to
be applicable to other AOP languages.

Modern source-level debuggers support dynamic breakpoints that are guarded by
conditions based on program state. Such breakpoints address situations where a
static breakpoint is not sufficiently precise to characterise a point of
interest in program execution. However, we believe that current IDE support
for dynamic breakpoints are cumbersome to use. Firstly, guard conditions
formulated in (nonaspect-oriented) source-languages cannot directly express
control-flow conditions, forcing developers to seek alternative formulations.
Secondly, guard-conditions can be complex expressions and manually typing them
is cumbersome.
</p>
<p>
We present the Control-flow Breakpoint Debugger (CBD). CBD uses a dynamic
pointcut language to characterise control-flow breakpoints---dynamic
breakpoints which are conditional on the control-flow through which they were
reached. CBD provides a "point-and-click" GUI to specify and incrementally
refine control-flow breakpoints, thereby avoiding the burden of manually
editing the potentially complex expressions that define them.
We performed 20 case studies debugging and fixing documented bugs in 3
existing applications. Our results show that dynamic breakpoints in general
are useful in practice, and that CBD&acute;s GUI allows specifying them adequately
in the majority of cases.

We define and study bisimulation for proving contextual equivalence in
an aspect extension of the untyped lambda-calculus. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of coinductive reasoning principles aimed at
proving equality of aspect programs.  The language we study is very
small, yet powerful enough to encode mutable references and a range of
temporal pointcuts (including cflow and regular event patterns).
</p>
<p>
Examples suggest that our bisimulation principle is useful.  For an
encoding of higher-order programs with state, our methods suffice to
establish well-known and well-studied subtle examples involving
higher-order functions with state.
</p>
<p>
Even in the presence of first class dynamic advice and expressive
pointcuts, our reasoning principles show that aspect-aware interfaces
can aid in ensuring that clients of a component are unaffected by
changes to an implementation.  Our paper generalizes existing results
given for \emph{open modules} to also include a variety of
history-sensitive pointcuts such as cflow and regular event patterns.
</p>

Our formal techniques and results suggest that aspects are amenable to
the formal techniques developed for stateful higher-order programs.

Beginning with BETA, a range of programming language mechanisms such as
virtual classes (class-valued attributes of objects) have been developed to
allow inheritance in the presence of mutually dependent classes. This paper
presents Tribe, a type system which generalises and simplifies other
formalisms of such mechanisms, by treating issues which are inessential for
soundness, such as the precise details of dispatch and field initialisation,
as orthogonal to the core formalism. Tribe can support path types dependent
simultaneously on both classes and objects, which is useful for writing
library code, and ubiquitous access to an object&acute;s family, which offers family
polymorphism without the need to drag around family arguments. Languages based
on Tribe will be both simpler and more expressive than existing designs, while
having a simpler type system, serving as a useful basis for future language
designs.

We study the denotational semantics of an aspect calculus by compositional
translation to a functional language with higher-order store and ML-style
references. The calculus is designed to construct only ``additive'' aspects
i.e. those that do not elide the execution of the base computation. Such an
aspect calculus is sufficiently expressive to encode before(), after() and
around() advice which calls proceed() exactly once.  We prove that our
translation is adequate i.e. it reflects observational equivalence. Further if
a standard object-oriented view of labels is adopted, the translation is fully
abstract i.e. it preserves and reflects observational equivalence. A pleasing
consequence is that full abstraction of the target-language semantics is
thereby inherited by the source-language semantics. This yields the first
fully abstract game model for a functional language of additive aspects.

e is a programming language designed for modeling and verification of
electronic systems. As such it is used extensively in the microchip industry,
and was recently declared an IEEE standard. e is also a powerful
general-purpose language used in the implementation of complex commercial
software tools.
</p>
<p>
It was suggested some time ago that a number of idioms in e resemble those of
AOP, but the suggestion was never examined in depth. The present paper takes
up this task. For this purpose the relevant mechanisms in e are compared with
those of today&acute;s prominent aspect-oriented language&mdash;AspectJ&mdash;with respect
to syntax, semantics, and application.
</p>
<p>
e&acute;s aspect-oriented capabilities turn out to be a small subset of AspectJ&acute;s,
but an interesting one. It is weaker in its support for implementing
developmental and non-functional concerns. However, with its simpler syntax
and economical semantics, e captures in a natural way crosscutting concerns
that stem from the application domain. Thus, e seems to exemplify an original
variant of AOP - one that is conservative and robust from a software design
point of view.

This paper proposes an approach called SCoPE, which supports
user-defined analysis-based pointcuts in aspect-oriented programming
(AOP) languages. The advantage of our approach is better
integration with existing AOP languages than previous approaches.
Instead of extending the language, SCoPE allows the programmer
to write a pointcut that analyzes a program by using a conditional
(if) pointcut with introspective reflection libraries. A compilation
scheme automatically eliminates runtime tests for such a pointcut.
The approach also makes effects of aspects visible to the analysis,
which is essential for determining proper aspect interactions. We
implemented a SCoPE compiler for the AspectJ language on top
of the AspectBench compiler using a backpatching technique. The
implementation efficiently finds analysis-based pointcuts, and generates
woven code without runtime tests for those pointcuts. Our
benchmark tests with JHotDraw and other programs showed that
SCoPE compiles programs with less than 1% compile-time overhead,
and generates a program that is as efficient as an equivalent
program that uses merely static pointcuts.

Wireless sensor networks consist of a system of distributed sensors embedded
in the physical world, and promise to allow observation of previously
unobservable phenomena.  Since they are exposed to unpredictable environments,
sensor-network applications must handle a wide variety of faults: software
errors, node and link failures, and network partitions. The code to manually
detect and recover from faults crosscuts the entire application, is tedious to
implement correctly and efficiently, and is fragile in the face of program
modifications. We investigate language support for modularly managing faults.
Our insight is that such support can be naturally provided as an extension to
existing ``macroprogramming'' systems for sensor networks. In such a system, a
programmer describes a sensor  network application as a centralized program; a
compiler then produces equivalent node-level programs. We describe a simple
checkpoint API for macroprograms, which can be automatically implemented in a
distributed fashion across the network.  We also describe declarative
annotations that allow programmers to specify checkpointing strategies at a
higher level of abstraction. We have implemented our approach in the Kairos
macroprogramming system. Experiments show it to improve application
availability by an order of magnitude and incur low messaging overhead.

cJ is an extension of Java that allows supertypes, fields, and methods
of a class or interface to be provided only under some static
subtyping condition. For instance, a cJ generic class, C,
may provide a member method m only when the type provided for
parameter P is a subtype of a specific type Q.
</p> 
<p>
From a practical standpoint, cJ adds to generic Java classes the
ability to express case-specific code. Unlike conditional compilation
techniques (e.g., the C/C++ <tt>#ifdef</tt> construct) cJ is
statically type safe and maintains the modular type-checking
properties of Java generic classes: a cJ generic class can be checked
independently of the code that uses it.  Just like regular Java,
checking a cJ class implies that all uses are safe, under the contract
for type parameters specified in the class&acute;s signature.
</p> 
<p>
As a specific application, cJ addresses the well-known shortcomings of
the Java Collections Framework (JCF).  JCF data structures often throw
run-time errors when an &ldquo;optional&rdquo; method is called upon an object
that does not support it.  Within the constraints of standard Java,
the authors of JCF had to either sacrifice static type safety or
suffer a combinatorial explosion of the number of types involved. cJ
avoids both problems, maintaining both static safety and conciseness.

This paper describes a method for studying idioms-based
implementations of crosscutting concerns, and our experiences with it in the
context of a real-world, large-scale embedded software system. In particular,
we analyse a seemingly simple concern, tracing, and show that it exhibits
significant variability, despite the use of a prescribed idiom. We discuss the
consequences of this variability in terms of how aspect-oriented software
development techniques could help prevent it, how it paralyses (automated)
migration efforts, and which aspect language features are required in order to
obtain precise and concise aspects. Additionally, we elaborate on the
representativeness of our results and on the usefulness of our proposed method.

Most current software systems contain undocumented high-
level ideas implemented across multiple ?les and modules.
When developers  perform program maintenance tasks, they
often waste time and e?ort locating and understanding these
scattered concerns. We have developed a semi-automated
concern location and comprehension tool, Find-Concept, designed 
to reduce the time developers spend on maintenance
tasks and to increase their confidence in the results of these
tasks. Find-Concept is effective because it searches a unique
natural language-based representation of source code, uses
novel techniques to expand initial queries into more effective
queries, and displays search results in an easy-to-comprehend
format. We describe the Find-Concept tool, the underlying 
program analysis, and an experimental study comparing Find-Concept&rsquo;s 
search effectiveness with two state-of-the-art lexical and information
retrieval-based search tools. Across nine action-oriented concern location
tasks derived from open source bug reports, our Eclipse-based tool produced
more effective queries more consistently than either competing search tool with
similar user effort.

Inspired by our past manual aspect mining experiences, this paper
describes a random walk model to approximate how crosscutting
concerns can be discovered in the absence of domain knowledge
of the investigated application. Random walks are performed on
the coupling graphs extracted from the program sources. The ideas
underlying the popular page-rank algorithm are adapted and extended
to generate ranks reflecting the degrees of &ldquo;popularity&rdquo; and
&ldquo;significance&rdquo; for each of the program elements on the coupling
graphs. Filtering techniques, exploiting both types of ranks, are applied
to produce a final list of candidates representing crosscutting
concerns. The resulting aspect mining algorithm is evaluated on numerous
Java applications ranging from a small-scale drawing application,
to a medium-sized middleware application, and to a largescale
enterprise application server. In seconds, the aspect mining
algorithm is able to produce results comparable to our prior manual
mining efforts. The mining algorithm also proves effective in
helping domain experts identify latent crosscutting concerns.
