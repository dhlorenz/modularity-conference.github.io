# A 'survey data group' consists of the following keys:
#
# - number       (required)
# - question     (required)
# - shortcut     (optional)
# - answer_type  (required)
# - weight       (optional; default is '1.0')
# - css_class    (optional)
#
# Syntax notes:
#
# - Empty lines and lines beginning with '#' are ignored.
# - Each survey data group has to start with the 'number' key. This is the unique identifier.
# - A key may consist of the following characters: 'A'-'Z', 'a'-'z', '0'-'9', '_' (underscore).
# - The leftmost space character separates the key from the value(s).
# - The value for the 'answer_type' key is an id and refers to an answer type defined in the 'answer_types.txt' file.
# - The value for the 'weight' key must be a (floating point) number >=0. '1' is the default value.
