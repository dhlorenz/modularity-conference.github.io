<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p style="">Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) has become more visible than ever with the upcoming release of AspectJ 5 and new sponsorship. How can you apply this technology effectively and gain value while avoiding the pitfalls of any promising new technology? This talk goes beyond theoretical introductions to provide practical insights drawn from using aspects in the enterprise. It focuses on three topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>valuable applications of aspects drawn from real-world experience </li>
  <li>integrating aspects with enterprise technologies and tools</li>
  <li>effective adoption</li>
  <li>hands-on exercises applying aspects </li>
</ul>
<p>This tutorial shows non-trivial applications of aspects drawn from real world experience. Examples include integration testing with virtual mock objects, crosscutting assertions in FIT tests, enforcing architectural guidelines, systematic error handling, enforcing data-level security, caching, monitoring, metering, tracking object ownership, and account suspension.</p>
<p>We demonstrate techniques for working effectively with leading enterprise servers such as J2EE containers, Hibernate, Spring, and Apache Axis. We also look at handling component dependencies in aspect-oriented systems, and using load-time weaving for effective development and deployment. We also illustrate effective tools integration: showing opportunities to apply recent advances in tools like the AJDT plugin for Eclipse. We also look at practical issues from existing limitations and tips for effective integration with other plugins and preserving module dependencies. We also look at fallback strategies to work with tools that don&rsquo;t have aspect support such as IntelliJ IDEA and Clover. </p>
<p>We conclude by looking at best practices and pitfalls in use, look at effective methods of handling aspects across the software development lifecycle for methodologies from waterfalls to XP. We look at techniques for getting organizational buy in and knowledge transfer, and discuss effective adoption strategies.</p>
<p style="">Attendees gain a practical understanding of how AOP can be useful, what to watch out for, and are in a good position to start applying AspectJ.</p>
<h3>Biographies</h3>
<p><strong>Ron Bodkin</strong> is the founder of New Aspects of Software, which helps enterprises leverage technology to build great systems. New Aspects provides consulting and training for software development with a focused on integrating Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) with lightweight Java, to build more adaptable software.

 

Previously, Ron led the first implementation projects and training efforts for customers of the AspectJ group at Xerox PARC. Prior to that, Ron was a founder and the CTO of C-bridge, a consultancy that delivered enterprise applications using frameworks for Java, XML, and other Internet technologies. C-bridge grew to 900 employees and a successful IPO in December of 1999.</p>
<p>Speaking Experience:
  
Ron consults, speaks and teaches extensively on AOP, having taught several tutorials and many classes for consulting customers, and attendees at advanced technology and industry conferences (e.g., AOSD, OOPSLA, Software Development, Colorado Software Summit, Edge, TheServerSide Symposium, STP, StarWEST, No Fluff Just Stuff, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Dean Wampler</strong> provides technical management and Architecture leadership for teams developing leading edge software applications using agile development techniques. He specializes in enterprise Java, aspect-oriented and object-oriented programming, agile methods, Internet, enterprise, and wireless applications. He enjoys teaching, mentoring and writing, too. Dean was previously the director of software development at BridgePort Networks. Prior to that Dean was a Sr. Product Manager at Rational where he was an early champion of Aspect-Oriented Programming.

 

Dean consults, speaks and teaches frequently on AOP, having given presentations and classes for customers and attendees at conferences such as JBossTwo and IBM DeveloperWorks Live. Dean has also been published on O’Reilly.</p>
