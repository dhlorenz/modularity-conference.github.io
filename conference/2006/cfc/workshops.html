<p> The AOSD.06 Organizing Committee invites proposals for one-day workshops to be held in conjunction with the AOSD.06 conference. A workshop is a collaborative forum where participants (typically 15 to 30) meet to exchange opinions, present ideas, and discuss preliminary results on a focused topic. The workshops at previous AOSD conferences have addressed a wide variety of areas including language foundations, software engineering and modeling, application of AOSD to specific domains, and commercialization. For AOSD.06, the conference committee again seeks to offer an exciting set of workshops on well-defined and focused topics that deal with emerging challenges and innovative approaches in AOSD. We particularly encourage workshop submissions that connect AOSD to other research communities. Each workshop proposal will be evaluated according to the value and relevance of its topic, the expertise and experience of the workshop organizers, and the workshop's potential for attracting participants and generating useful results. We would like to stress the importance of active and creative workshops that foster a collaborative environment of interest to both practitioners and researchers. </p>

<h2>Submission Guidelines </h2>

<p>A workshop proposal must be authored by at least two organizers, preferably from different institutions, and should contain the following information:</p>

<ol>
	<li> <strong>About each Organizer: </strong>	
	  <ul>
	  <li> Name </li>
	  <li> Contact information </li>
	  <li> Affiliation, job title, postal address, email address, URL, phone number, and fax number </li>
	  <li> Brief biography </li>
	  <li> 100&ndash;200 words, focusing on the organizer's expertise in the field and experience as a workshop organizer </li>
	  <li> Primary contact </li>
	  <li> Identify one organizer as the primary contact </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>About the Workshop:
    </strong>	  
	  <ul>
	  <li> Title</li>
	  <li> Abstract: <br>
	    150&ndash;200 words describing the workshop, suitable for the conference Web site and advance program </li>
	  <li> Topics and motivation: <br>
	    What are the topics, themes, and areas of interest of the workshop? How is the workshop relevant to AOSD? How does the workshop connect AOSD to other research communities, if at all? </li>
	  <li> Goals and expected results:<br> 
	    Explicitly state the goals of the workshop and how you intend to reach them. What are the expected results of the workshop? How will these results be disseminated? </li>
	  <li> Format:<br> 
	    What is the planned workshop format? What will be done to stimulate collaborative interaction? What are the planned pre- and post-workshop activities? </li>
	  <li> Participants: <br>
	    What is the expected number of participants? Explain why this workshop will attract a sufficient number of attendees. Specify the participant selection process. </li>
	  <li> Previous workshops: <br>
	    Have there been previous workshops on the same topic? When, where, and how many participants? </li>
	  <li> Required equipment: <br>
	    Overhead projector, PC projector, whiteboard, flip charts, microphone, etc. </li>
	  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>A  Preliminary Call for Workshop Papers: </strong>    
    <p>This will necessarily repeat some of the information from the previous sections, but should be targeted towards prospective participants. The workshop call for papers should address the following items:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Overview of the motivation, topics, and goals </li>
      <li> Workshop format </li>
      <li> Submission guidelines and review process </li>
      <li> References to previous workshops (Web sites) </li>
    </ul> 
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
<p>Proposals must be submitted in ASCII text, PostScript, PDF, or MS Word format. Relevant supporting materials, such as proceedings from previous offerings of the proposed workshop (or other workshops run by the proposal authors), should be included if available but are not required for submission. </p>
<p>To obtain a balanced and cohesive workshop program, the AOSD.06 Organizing Committee will collaborate closely with workshop organizers and reserves the right to circulate proposals to other submitters in view of possible workshop mergers. The organizers of an accepted workshop will be required to create and maintain a Web site in a timely manner to serve as a workshop information center and to provide a repository for documenting pre- and post-workshop activities. Workshop organizers can set up their own dates for paper submission but the AOSD.06 Workshop Co-Chairs will require all workshops to have a uniform notification deadline. The notification deadline is expected to be approximately February 5, 2006. We recommend a paper submission deadline around January 17, 2006.</p>
<h2>Submission Deadlines</h2>

<p> Workshop proposals must be sent via email to the AOSD.06 Workshop Co-Chairs at workshops<img src="../img/z.gif" border="0" alt="@">aosd.net, and must be received no later than Thursday, October 14, 2005. Early submissions allow us to provide feedback that can improve the final proposal. Notifications to submitters will be made no later than Monday, November 14, 2005. Workshop organizers should be prepared to have initial Web sites and initial calls for papers to the Workshop Co-Chairs by Monday, November 21, 2005.
<h2>Contact</h2>

<p> For additional information, clarifications, questions, or special requirements, please contact the AOSD.06 Workshop Co-Chairs, Siobh&aacute;n Clarke and Klaus Ostermann  (workshops<img src="../img/z.gif" border="0" alt="@">aosd.net).</p>
