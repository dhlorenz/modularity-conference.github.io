<p>The <a href="http://www.hdg.de/indexeng.html" target="_blank">Haus
der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland</a> presents German
history from 1945 until today. It is freely accessible to the public and
provides guided tours and information material in many languages.</p>
<p>This museum is located along the so-called &quot;museum mile&quot;,
and if you choose to visit it, this is the perfect time to jump into
another museum, too!</p>
