<p>Before the German government moved to Berlin, the building nicknamed &quot;Langer Eugen&quot; had been the office building for the members of the parliament. Today, it is used by the United Nations and several educational institutions. Its nickname is due to the fact that it had been the tallest building in Bonn  before the Deutsche Post Tower was built.</p>
