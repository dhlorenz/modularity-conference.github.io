<p>This is an architectural highlight - the <a href="http://www.kah-bonn.de/index_e.htm" target="_blank">National Art and Exhibition Hall</a> was designed by Gustav Peichl and is marked by three striking light spires and a roof garden. 16 columns in front of the museum represent the 16 states of the Federal Republic of Germany. The exhibitions change, but are always worth looking. For example, a major exhibition of key works from the collection of the Guggenheim Museum is planned for 2006.</p>
<p>This museum is located along the so-called &quot;museum mile&quot;, and if you choose to visit it, this is the perfect time to jump into another museum, too!</p>
