<p>Living history: Founded around the year 1230, the Kommende Ramersdorf was the home of a community of knights. Starting from 1804, it changed its owner several times and was close to be pulled down in 1967, when a new highway should be constructed. However, it was saved and now belongs to a family of antique dealers, who has integrated a hotel and a restaurant into this beautiful building.</p>
