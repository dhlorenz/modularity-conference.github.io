<p>PROSE (PROgrammable extenSions of sErvices), an open source project 
(<a href="http://prose.ethz.ch/" target="_blank">http://prose.ethz.ch/</a>), 
is an adaptive middleware platform based on Java for 
dynamic AOP which allows aspects to be woven, unwoven, or replaced at run time. 
Woven into a program, an aspect may change several units of functionality. 
Aspects are expressed in the same source language as the application (Java). 
PROSE provides middleware tools that allow run time monitoring of remote 
aspects. The PROSE workbench for weaving, unweaving and querying aspects is a 
monitoring tool which displays information about what aspects are currently 
inserted in the system, what join-points belong to each aspect, and what the 
join-points of the system are. Embedded into an Eclipse plug-in, this tool is 
also used to developing and running PROSE applications from Eclipse and allows 
run time monitoring of remote aspects, and provides a creation wizard that helps 
to create PROSE aspects.</p>

<p>In this demonstration we present PROSE and its associated middleware tools. We 
show the flexibility of PROSE and how it has been embedded into Eclipse, and 
present a variety of examples of run time adaptation. In the first part of the 
demonstration we show how to modify the behavior of a running application by 
dynamically weaving an aspect that identifies places of interest in the 
application. After each weaving operation, we show that the running application 
has been adapted and we use the PROSE middleware tools to graphically display 
the join-points matched by the woven aspect. In the second part of the 
demonstration we show how easy is to create aspects that modify a program at run 
time using the creation wizard of the PROSE Development Tools for Eclipse. When 
an aspect is created, the user can select the PROSE crosscut types and 
pointcutters from a list. Then the code template for a PROSE aspect that defines 
an advice method and a poincut method will be generated. The aspects are then 
woven remotely into different VMs. After the weaving operation, we show that the 
running application has been adapted. In case of two running applications, we 
show that the aspects can be cut and pasted between distinct VMs using the PROSE 
workbench and also can be moved between distinct VMs by drag and drop using the 
PROSE plug-in for Eclipse. We also show how to insert and withdraw aspects 
transactionally. We start a transaction and then weave and unweave aspects 
into/from different VMs.</p>

<p>Aspect insertions and withdrawals won't be activated until the transaction is 
committed. The transaction can also be aborted, leaving the application as if no 
insertion or withdrawal ever took place.</p>
