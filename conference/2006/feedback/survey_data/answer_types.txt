# Each question (with its answer options) of the survey is grouped and has the following properties:
#
# id     = A unique id (string or number). (required)
# style  = The layout of the answer options. (required)
#          Possible styles:
#            - cb  (checkbox)
#            - rb  (radiobutton)
#            - sb  (selectbox)
#            - msb (multiple selectbox)
#            - tf  (text field)
#            - ta  (text area)
# labels = The rendered labels for each answer option. (required)
#          The order matters! (e.g. a yes/no answer has labels 'yes' and 'no')
#          An asterisk (*) at the end of a label indicates the default label.
# values = The internal values of the labels. (optional)
#          If not given the values are the same as the labels.
