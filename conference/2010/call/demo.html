Demonstrations serve to disseminate advances embodied in research-oriented tools and systems that use or support AOSD. Attendees learn about emerging technologies and have opportunities to interact with their developers. Presenters gain excellent opportunities to increase the visibility and impact of their work. AOSD.10 solicits high quality proposals for its demonstration track. Demonstrations can range across commercial, academic, and corporate research systems.<p/>

Demonstrations will be selected on the basis of technical merit, novelty, relevance to the AOSD community, and feasibility of presentation. The presentation should be focused on technical content and given by the technical members of the team.<p/>

There are two types of demonstrations: Forum demos and Tabletop demos. The intent is to split demos into those that can be shown without a formal presentation and those that require one.<p/>

In Tabletop demos, the presenter is seated at a table, and is surrounded by a number of chairs for attendants. There is no conceptual introduction, instead the demonstration starts with showing the tool itself. This form of demonstration is especially suited for extensions to tools which are well known, as no introduction is needed, or for demos where more interaction with the audience is expected, as the setting is more intimate. Tabletop demos are allocated 30 minutes, with 20 minutes for the demonstration and 10 minutes for questions and discussion. Authors of regular research papers are also welcome to submit accompanying demonstrations.<p/>

Forum demos start with a conceptual introduction of about 10 minutes before the tool itself is demonstrated. This form of demos is suited for tools which are not well-known or new, or have been significantly extended in recent times. A Forum demo is allocated 45 minutes, with 10 minutes for a presentation, 25 minutes for the demonstration and 10 minutes for questions and discussion.</p>

Every demonstration will be scheduled twice for presentation. Also, demonstration presenters will have the opportunity to give a 1-minute overview of their demonstration during a conference plenary session.<p/>

There will also be space set aside where any conference attendee can give an informal demonstration. Demonstrations included in the program are also allowed and encouraged to be presented informally.
