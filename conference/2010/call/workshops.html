        We invite proposals for one-day workshops to be held in conjunction with the AOSD.10 conference. A workshop is a collaborative forum where participants meet to exchange opinions, present ideas, and discuss preliminary research ideas and results. Workshops can be structured in formats ranging from "mini-track" conferences to smaller, more focused problem solving sessions. We encourage proposals on focused topics that deal with emerging challenges and innovative approaches in AOSD, and particularly encourage proposals on AOSD-related topics that are novel or of emerging importance. Each workshop proposal will be evaluated according to the value and relevance of its topic, the expertise and experience of the workshop organizers, and the workshop's potential for attracting participants and generating useful results. We stress the importance of active and creative workshops that foster a collaborative environment of interest to both practitioners and researchers. We encourage workshop proposals that are highly interactive, rather than mini-conferences. Please include in the submission a plan to foster interaction and creativity during the workshop.

		Submission requirements
		</div>
        
          <div class="txt0">
        <div class="gray" align="justify"> 
        Proposals must be submitted in ASCII text, PostScript, PDF, or MS Word format. Relevant supporting materials, such as proceedings from previous offerings of the proposed workshop (or other workshops run by the proposal authors), should be included if available but are not required for submission.<br><br>
        To obtain a balanced and cohesive workshop program, the Conference Committee will collaborate closely with workshop organizers and reserves the right to circulate proposals to other submitters in view of possible workshop mergers. The organizers of an accepted workshop will be required to create and maintain a Web site in a timely manner to serve as a workshop information center and to provide a repository for documenting pre- and post-workshop activities. Workshop organizers can set up their own dates for paper submission but the Workshop Chair will require all workshops to have a uniform notification deadline. The notification deadline is expected to be approximately January 15, 2010. We recommend a paper submission deadline around December 21, 2009.

		A Preliminary Call for Workshop Papers
		</div>
                  <div class="txt0">
        <div class="gray" align="justify"> 
This will necessarily repeat some of the information from the previous sections, but should be targeted towards prospective participants. The workshop call for papers should address the following items:
<ul>
<li>Overview of the motivation, topics, and goals</li>
<li>Workshop format</li>
<li>Submission guidelines and review process</li>
<li>References to previous workshops (Web sites)</li>
</ul>
<br>
Note: The conference organizers are preserving an option to include all workshop papers in both the electronic conference proceedings and in the ACM Digital Library. For this option to be feasible, final versions of each workshop paper will have to be prepared for publication (using ACM formatting and granting ACM copyright) and will have to be limited in length to five pages. Note that this requirement is for the actual workshop papers, not the workshop proposals. Your own proposal should mention these requirements, however, in the sample Call for Papers.

The Workshop Chair will confirm receipt of every submission. Early submissions allow us to provide feedback that can improve the final proposal. Notifications to submitters will be made no later than Friday, October 23, 2009. Workshop organizers should be prepared to have initial Web sites and initial calls for papers to the Workshop Chair by Friday, October 30, 2009.
