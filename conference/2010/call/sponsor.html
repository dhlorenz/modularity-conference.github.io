The International Conference on Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD) is the premier conference on software modularity, with an emphasis on modular structures that cut across traditional abstraction boundaries. The conference offers several tracks, including the Research and Industry Tracks, which bring together leading researchers and practitioners working in such fields as software engineering, programming languages, systems, and others.
<br>
AOSD attracts an international audience of 200 people from different communities and mixing industrial and academics. AOSD 2010 seeks to foster richer notions of modularity and abstractions for software and software-intensive systems increasing the emphasis on modularity not only of code, but across lifecycle artifacts (e.g., from requirements to tests). AOSD 2010 is concerned with modularity across the whole software ecosystems, including the organizations and processes that define, develop, deploy, operate, protect, evolve and use these systems in a more agile way. AOSD’10 will dedicate a whole day to the industrial practices related to an increased modularity in software development. This day will include an industrial keynote, tutorials, tool demonstrations and industrial presentations.
<br>
In 2010, the AOSD conference will be held in Rennes and Saint-Malo, France. Rennes is the capital of Brittany and, together with Lannion and Saint-Malo, is part of what is known as the French “Telecom-Valley”, since most of the major players of the country’s telecommunications industry have a site in this region (e.g., Alcatel, France-Télécom, Thomson) and it hosts 40% of France's telecom sector public research. Rennes is easily accessed by plane or by train from Paris and Paris Charles de Gaulle airport.
<br>
Saint-Malo is a corsair (a corsair is a kind of official “pirate”, hired by the king) city located on the north coast of Brittany, close to the Mont Saint-Michel and to Rennes. Every street corner, every shore recalls the city's legendary past, along the innumerable walks and seafront promenades. Train from Paris or Rennes accesses Saint-Malo.
<br>
We are looking for both academic and industrial sponsors for the organization of this conference. By sponsoring this event you have the opportunity to advertise your tools, methodologies and success stories and to make the conference audience aware of them.
