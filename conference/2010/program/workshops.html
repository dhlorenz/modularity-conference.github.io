        <div class="gray" align="justify"> 
       FOAL is a forum for research in foundations of aspect-oriented programming languages. Areas of interest include but are not limited to: semantics of aspect-oriented languages, specification and verification for such languages, type systems, static analysis, theory of testing, theory of aspect composition, and theory of aspect translation (compilation) and rewriting. The workshop aims to foster work in foundations, including formal studies, promote the exchange of ideas, and encourage workers in the semantics, types, and formal methods communities to do research in the area of aspect-oriented programming languages.

       Composition can be applied in particular on Objects, Aspects, SOA, Component-Based architectures and may address various phases of the development process such as: GUI, design, programming, deployment, and maintenance. There is already a conference on the general topic of composition (Software Composition 2010 and previous), this workshop will focus in particular on the problems linked with any combination of a topic taken in “Composition and paradigms” and “Composition and product lines”.

         <div class="txt1">
        <div class="gray" align="justify"> 
       Early aspects are crosscutting concerns that exist in requirements analysis, 
domain analysis and architecture design activities of software lifecycle. Work on early aspects focuses on systematically identifying, modularizing, and analyzing such crosscutting concerns and their impact at these early phases of the software development. 
The general aim of this workshop is to facilitate cross-fertilization of ideas in requirements engineering, domain engineering, software architecture design, and aspect-oriented software development in order to identify the problems and potential solutions, and continue the maturation of Early Aspects as a discipline. The present edition of the workshop will provide a forum for an open set of early-aspects related topics, without restricting to a specific theme or domain.

       Although aspect-oriented modeling techniques have been largely investigated at the model level, application on the meta-modeling level are not yet common. However, there are a number of interesting approaches for applying aspect-oriented techniques at the meta-modeling level, such as providing variability in UML or DSMLs. The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers that are applying aspect-oriented techniques at the meta-modeling level, and discuss issues concerning the application of aspect-oriented technologies in the meta-modeling domain.

  Empirical Evaluation of Software Composition Techniques (ESCOT)

        <div class="gray" align="justify"> 
       Empirical evaluation is a key activity to enable us to reach evidence and learn about the quality of our software artefacts. With aspect-oriented and related composition techniques, such as model composition techniques, collaboration languages, and feature-oriented programming, fast gaining wide attention in both research and industry environments, there is a pressing need to define proper assessment mechanisms, techniques, and methods to evaluate these new composition techniques. 

This workshop, that takes place on 16 March 2010 at AOSD 2010 (in Rennes and Saint Malo, France) provides a forum to present and discuss empirical evaluations, as well preliminary results and initial experimental designs.

 	Domain-Specific Aspect Languages

         <div class="txt1">
        <div class="gray" align="justify"> 
       The tendency to raise the abstraction level in programming languages towards a particular domain is also a major driving force in the research domain of aspect-oriented programming languages. Pioneering work in this field was conducted by devising small domain-specific aspect languages (DSALs) such as COOL for concurrency management and RIDL for serialization, RG, AML, and others. After a dominating focus on general-purpose languages, research in the AOSD community is again taking this path in search of innovative approaches, insights and a deeper understanding of fundamentals behind AOP. The workshop aims to bring the research communities of domain-specific language engineering and domain-specific aspect design together.

 	Aspects, Components, and Patterns for Infrastructure Software (ACP4IS)
    </div>
         <div class="txt1">
        <div class="gray" align="justify"> 
      Aspect-oriented programming, component models, and design patterns are modern and actively evolving techniques for improving the modularization of complex software. In particular, these techniques hold great promise for the development of "systems infrastructure" software, e.g., application servers, middleware, virtual machines, compilers, operating systems, and other software that provides general services for higher-level applications. The developers of infrastructure software are faced with increasing demands from application programmers needing higher-level support for application development. Meeting these demands requires careful use of software modularization techniques, since infrastructural concerns are notoriously hard to modularize. Building on the ACP4IS meetings at all of the past AOSD conferences, this workshop aims to provide a highly interactive forum for researchers and developers to discuss the application of and relationships between aspects, components, and patterns within modern infrastructure software. The goal is to put aspects, components, and patterns into a common reference frame and to build connections between the software engineering and systems communities.
