       Studentships for AOSD 2010
        </div>

          	The AOSD Conference is committed to supporting students working in this area via a dedicated Student Forum programme. At the Forum students will obtain extensive feedback to their work, benefit from research events, and receive general academic skills training. All ASOD students are invited to participate in the AOSD Student Forum. More details on the Forum are available at <a href="../forum.html">http://www.aosd.net/2010/forum.php</a>.
            </p>
            For AOSD 2010, ten studentships are supported by the AOSD-Europe network of Excellence (<a href="http://www.aosd-europe.net/index.htm">http://www.aosd-europe.net/index.htm</a>) for selected EU students.
            </p>
            The studentships are intended to facilitate students with limited funds to attend AOSD, engage with the Student Forum, as well as to encourage integration of the group that work on AOSD or related topics but have been previously underrepresented (or disjointed ) from the AOSD community.
            </p>
            To apply for an AOSD-Europe studentship, the interested students are invited to submit:
            <ul>
<li>an extended research abstract (as required for the Spring School attendance: ../student/spring.php ) and</li>
<li>a brief statement (up to half a page) stating how attending AOSD will benefit their work (as well as any particular circumstances that the student may wish to point out, if relevant);</li>
<li>a brief (up to half a page) statement by a senior member from students research group (e.g. the supervisor, or the head of the group that the student is working in) stating how AOSD is relevant to their group and how the research in their group can be integrated with the work in AOSD community.</li>
</ul>
</p>
The submissions should be emailed to the Student Forum Chair (Ruzanna Chitchyan) on students_at_aosd.net .
</p>
<b>Submission deadline is 19th of January 2010, 23:59 (Samoan time).</b>
</p>
The selection committee will comprise of the AOSD 2010 General Chair,the Organising Chair, and the Student Forum Chair. The applications will be judged on the relevance of the student work to AOSD, the potential extension of the AOSD community via integration of related work from new/underrepresented research groups, and the circumstances of individual students. Please note that the members of active AOSD groups will not be unfairly disadvantaged.
