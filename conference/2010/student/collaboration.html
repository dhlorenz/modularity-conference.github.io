          	Several large research projects will be invited to hold a panel on the cutting edge work on AOSD in large scale Research and Development. The panel will be followed with a collaboration session, whereby the participating students will have a chance to discuss with the project representatives how their work can integrate with the projects and look for (short term) placement opportunities. Note, this is not a job fair, but an opportunity to establish research collaborations.Details of the projects and possible opportunities to be confirmed.

          	AOSD 2010 includes a new Project Collaboration event for research and development projects. A set of R&D projects will have an opportunity to present their work at the conference (15 min. presentation) and to engage with students working on relevant topics.
            </p>
            Requirements to the R&D projects:
<ul>
<li>The project's research and/or development should be related to AO;</li>
<li>A project representative should attend the AOSD conference to
introduce the on-going work and to outline what are the open issues the
project is interested in exploring.</li>
<li>The interested students will then have a discussion slot with the
relevant project representatives to discuss their ideas on these issues
and potential collaborative work.</li>

        <div class="gray" align="justify">
        Issues on specific collaboration format (e.g., how to involve students,
working remotely or locally, etc.) will be driven by the specific
project/student circumstance. The aim of this event is to identify and
connect mutually interested parties and provide opportunities to meet
and work out their own collaboration schedules/details.

        Participation in this event provides two main benefits:
        <ul>
<li>Project Dissemination: the selected projects will be invited to give
a 15 min. presentation at the AOSD conference (please note that
registration for AOSD conference is a pre-requirement for the
presentation).</li>
<li>The projects will potentially identify students to work on the topics
that they are interested in researching/developing.</li>

        Students will get an opportunity to find and engage with projects
related to their work. This could involve, for instance, using the
projects as evaluators; gaining experience of research collaboration;
developing industry-relevant software and joint publications, etc.
