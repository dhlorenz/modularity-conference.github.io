<b>ObjectTeams.</b> The aspect-oriented programming language ObjectTeams/Java
takes an approach based on <b><i>views </i></b>and<b><i> collaborations</i></b>. ObjectTeams
encapsulates aspects in potentially interacting <b><i>roles</i></b> (views)
whereby role instances are contained in <b><i>team</i></b> instances (collaborations).
Roles can be used for aspectizing programs by decorating classes in three
major ways, which can be combined freely:
<ul>
<li>
Intercepting and augmenting control flow.</li>

<li>
Adding new behaviour to classes and object.</li>

<li>
Forwarding role messages to existing objects.</li>
</ul>
The poster presents the various <b><i>dimensions of dynamism</i></b> realized
in ObjectTeams.
<p><b>1. Deployment or activation time of aspects.<i> </i></b>This dimension
identifies which aspects rsp. roles are active and for which scope. Roles
for decorating objects are created implicitly with further fine grained
control. ObjectTeams allows to control:
<ul>
<li>
for which object instances these role instances are activated.</li>

<li>
for which duration these role instances are activated.</li>
</ul>
All this is accomplished through controling the <b><i>activation of team
instances</i></b> in which roles are contained and encapsulated. Roles
can be activated and deactivated per team instance at runtime, either for
the entire application or for a block of statements. Thus, aspect activation
is moulded into the language itself in an imperative manner and completely
controled at runtime.
<p><b>2. Dynamic binding of aspects.<i> </i></b>This dimension is in analogy
to object-oriented polymorphism, which allows to determine the most suitable
method implementation at runtime. In a context where objects are decorated
with roles this issue arises in two additional flavours, namely <b><i>role-object
binding</i></b> and <b><i>role polymorphism</i></b>.
<ul>
<li>
During role instance creation the most suitable role type has to be determined.
This involves analysis of the team inheritance and the role inheritance
hierarchies.</li>

<li>
The most suitable implementation of the desired role method has to be determined.</li>
</ul>
<b>3. Aspect weaving time.</b> We view weaving not as a feature in its
own right but merely as a support which allows for the desired behaviour
according to the previous two dimensions. Weaving is deferred to <b><i>load-time</i></b>
which simplifies organisational issues like configuration management, build
management, and deployment.
<p><b>4. Definition time of aspects</b>.<i> </i>Currently, ObjectTeams
does not support dynamic, i.e., runtime, definition of roles and teams.
We envision a reflection-based solution for this extending the Java class
loading mechanism at runtime.
