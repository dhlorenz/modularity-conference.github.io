<h2>Call for Student Research Competition</h2>
<p>MODULARITY: aosd•2013 is hosting an <a href="http://src.acm.org/">ACM Student Research
Competition</a> (SRC). The competition, sponsored by <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Research</a>,
is an internationally-recognized venue that enables <b>undergraduate</b> and
<b>graduate students</b> to experience the research world, share their research results with other
students and MODULARITY: aosd•2013 attendees, and compete for prizes. The ACM Student Research
Competition shares the Poster session's goal to facilitate students' interaction with researchers
and industry practitioners; providing both sides with the opportunity to learn of ongoing, current
research. Additionally, the Student Research Competition affords students with experience with
both formal presentations and evaluations.</p>

<h2>Competition</h2>
<p>Submissions must be original work that is neither in submission nor already published at AOSD
or another conference or journal. Student Research Competition submissions will be simultaneously
considered as poster submissions. Students who are not selected to participate in the Student
Research Competition will be considered for the poster event.</p>

<p>The submission should describe:</p>

<ul>
   <li> The research problem and motivation</li>
   <li> Background and related work</li>
   <li> Approach and uniqueness</li>
   <li> Results and contributions</li>
</ul>

<p>Submissions should not exceed 800 words and must be in ACM SIGPLAN Proceedings format.
Submissions are reviewed by a panel of experts, and are evaluated based upon the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
   <li> Quality of work</li>
   <li> Novelty of approach</li>
   <li> Significance of contribution</li>
   <li> Clarity of written presentation</li>
</ul>

<p>A maximum of 20 students (10 undergraduates, 10 graduates) will be selected to participate
in the Student Research Competition at MODULARITY: aosd•2013. Students whose submissions are
accepted to participate in the competition are entitled to a stipend for their travel expenses,
up to a maximum of US$500.</p>

<p>At the conference, the first round of the competition evaluates the research during a poster
presentation. The poster presentation is evaluated based on two facets:</p>

<ul>
   <li> The presentation of the research, including the visual aspects of the poster and the student's oral discussion.</li>
   <li> The research, specifically its quality, novelty, and the significance of the contribution.</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on the results from the poster session, the judges will select students to advance
to the second round of the competition.</p>

<p>During the second round of the competition, students give a 10-minute presentation of their
research, followed by a five-minute question and answer period. The presentation is evaluated by
a panel of judges, and the top three winners in each category are selected.</p>

<h2>Prizes</h2>
<p>The top three winners at AOSD 2013 in each category (undergraduate and graduate) will receive
prizes of US$500, US$300, and US$200, respectively. All winners also receive an award certificate
and two-year complimentary ACM membership with a subscription to ACM's Digital Library. Winners
will be recognized during the conference. These winners will also go on to compete in the ACM
Student Research Competition Grand Finals with winners from other ACM conferences.</p>

<h2>Competition Requirements</h2>
<p>Participants must be undergraduates or graduate students pursuing an academic degree
at the time of initial submission. The contest has two categories, one for undergraduate research
and the other for graduate research. Three winners will be selected in each category. Research
completed while the student was an undergraduate may be submitted to the undergraduate category
even if the student is now a first-year graduate student. Participants must provide a signed
letter from their academic supervisor confirming that they are registered as a full-time student
and that at least 50% of their working week is spent following an academic course of study.
Additionally, participants must be current members of the ACM, and must provide their ACM member
number.</p>

<p>Although the ACM and MODULARITY: aosd•2013 recognize the importance of collaborative
research, the Student Research Competition is meant to be an opportunity for junior students
to develop their skills as researchers and to give them an opportunity to showcase their work.
One of the goals of the program is to focus on the student, their capabilities as a researcher,
and their potential. As such, only individual research projects will be considered for the
Student Research Competition. Supervisors of the work may not be listed as co-authors;
you must submit a single-authored version of your work for the competition.</p>
