<p><a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-roo">Spring Roo</a> provides a powerful means of improving efficiency and
productivity for experienced software engineers.  Though there have
been several experience reports and testimonials along these lines,
this report highlights an unexpected role we have uncovered for the
tool suite: <em>a best practices guide for newbies</em>.</p>

<p>In this experience report we describe how Spring Roo can be leveraged
as a means of
bridging the gap for novice programmers.  We
focus our case study on course materials from a first year class on the
World Wide Web and Mobile Applications.  This course assumes no prior
programming
experience, and exposes students to basic concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Given the highly motivated disposition and diverse backgrounds of these
students, it becomes clear that this app-savvy generation are indeed
ready to dive-in and leverage tool suites in ways that previously
would have been considered far too advanced for their level of
experience. Guided by a simple set of first principles that structures
their efforts according to a Model, View, Controller design strategy,
they have successfully  deployed simple mobile applications through
services such as <a href="https://build.phonegap.com/">Phone Gap Build</a>.</p>

<p>This report identifies the path we are attempting to carve for
newbie-developers consisting of four stages: (1) simple tools
leveraging MVC to structure HTML, CSS and JavaScript, such as
<a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, (2) more advanced tools such as the <a href="http://www.springsource.org/sts">Spring Tool Suite</a>
(STS) and templates such as <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html">SpringMVC</a>, (3) powerful yet concise ways of
generating new functionality with <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-roo">Spring Roo</a>, and (4) backend cloud
deployments using <a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.com/">CloudFoundry</a> within STS.  We identify the ways in
which we believe this is a natural progression appropriate for a new
generation of students.  From our observations, we
conclude that STS and Spring Roo allow newbies to experiment with
previously unencountered features of databases, web tiers, testing,
application servers and cloud deployments in an unencumbered way.</p>

<h2 id="stage1mvcandjsfiddle">Stage 1: MVC and <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a></h2>

<p>In this first stage of the journey, students experiment with existing
code and derive their own in a collaborative online environment
designed to separate concerns addressed by HTML, CSS and JavaScript
into a Model, View, Controller strategy.  The environment, <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>,
fosters this separation by dividing the screen into four
quadrants---one for each of these components, plus the final one for
the live result of their combination.  An example assignment included
a  <a href="http://i.imgur.com/O5fSh">monster game in jsFiddle</a>, where users
can increase their score each time they click on a moving monster,
whose speed increases every level of the game.</p>

<h2 id="stage2springtoolsuiteandthespringmvctemplate">Stage 2: <a href="http://www.springsource.org/sts">Spring Tool Suite</a> and the <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html">SpringMVC</a> Template</h2>

<p>Though moving from <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a> to a more sophisticated environment is
challenging, this part of the journey merely involves navigating a
given project within STS.
The downloaded package, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/MndQV">SpringMVC </a>,
consists of a simple webpage that they can understand,
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/14Ynh">home.jsp</a>, along with more extensive Java
code than they have previously seen
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/nDBTW">HomeController.java</a>.  Running the
application and viewing the page on a local machine can be
accomplished by dragging and dropping the package onto the server also
made available through STS.</p>

<h2 id="stage3springroo">Stage 3: <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-roo">Spring Roo</a></h2>

<p>Several tutorials from Spring Roo are
strangely powerful from a newbie’s perspective.  Though our students
do not understand what many of the
incantations are doing at the <em>roo command line</em>, they do know that
within minutes they can launch multilingual webpages with backend
databases.  Unfortunately,
our students also lack the experience to debug the system if they do
have problems.  However, by using the command line available in STS,
they can monitor changes derive best-practice patterns from the
scripts provided.  For example, a sample first-impressions pass of the
<em>clinic.roo</em> <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-roo/reference/html/command-index.html#command-index-script">script</a> as
interpreted by a enthusiastic student without any extensive Java
programming experience <a href="http://i.imgur.com/YLOhP">is included here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="stage4stsandcloudfoundry">Stage 4:  STS and <a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.com/">CloudFoundry</a></h2>

<p>As with deploying on the localhost, once students have a CloudFoundry
account the can <a href="http://i.imgur.com/5X0HN">drag and drop to server</a>.
From the SpringMVC template, they can add their previous monster
assignment from jsFiddle and run it their game <a href="http://i.imgur.com/JAyZ1">in the
cloud</a>.  Also within STS, they can explore
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/596lO">cloud configuration</a> and a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/3bx3u">remote system
view</a>.  It is important to note that, once
comfortable in this environment, STS becomes a powerful dashboard,
incorporating both <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4rnMa">Roo and CloudFoundry</a>.</p>

<h2 id="wheredothesestagestakeus">Where Do These Stages Take Us?</h2>

<p>Most of the students in our course have never built a web
application, interfaced a Java program with a database, or even
written extensive test suites.  They do, however, have a very clear
idea of what they want from their web applications.  That is, at a
high-level, they have a basic idea of system components and their
interaction, though they have no hands-on experience putting them all
together.</p>

<p>This staged approach through tools, MVC, databases, and cloud
deployment---all at a very high level---gives students the ability to
build and investigate real applications. Using sample Spring Roo
scripts, students can quickly
appreciate the components of a given system, and learn how to build
industrial strength web applications with relatively little Java
experience.</p>

<p>Though certainly, several parts of the script and codebase require
much more experience to interpret, this top-down approach is powerful.  It
gives students a critical starting point to build from.  Based on an
accumulation of first impressions such as these, many more
applications can be pieced together <em>by a newbie</em> on the order of days
as opposed to months.  This goes way beyond the proof-of-concept
approach we typically use.</p>

<p>Additionally,
a resulting prototype generated through these means has much more
potential to be understood by
other students reasoning through the codebase than the classic code
produced from ad hoc attempts to get newly encountered system
components to work.  Systematic addition of the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-springroo3/index.html">email</a> and <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-springroo3/index.html">security</a>
packages in Spring Roo further enhance a student's understanding of
the extensibility of the resulting system.</p>

<h2 id="findingsandchallenges">Findings and Challenges</h2>

<p>These results not only have traction in terms of raising stakeholders
awareness for prototype applications developed by newbies, but also in
terms of gratifying students who are early on the
learning curve for this kind of software engineering task.  We believe
these stages can be incrementally refined
easily within the STS environment.  Unlike the experts however, the
novices appreciate <em>what</em> the functionality does, but don’t
immediately recognize <em>how</em> it does it.  They can, however, begin to
inspect the generated code, and appreciate what some of these commands
do.  In that regard, we see STS plus Spring Roo as facilitating the
same kind of incremental adaptation encouraged by the jsFiddle
environment.</p>

<p>One practical challenge we face in academic settings is getting new
software installed lab machines, as this has to go through layers of
administration and is typically only done once a year.  For that
reason, online tools are incredibly valuable in our setting.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>The World Wide Web is becoming a playing field for everyone, not just
software professionals.  HTML, CSS and JavaScript parceled out as
mobile applications have put new power in the hands of enthusiasts who
envision functionality that previously could only be delivered by
experienced programmers.  We have examples of students from a wide
array of disciplines designing mobile apps that require substantial
backend server support.  Our challenge is no longer to teach them what
an "app" is, but instead to give them the power to make their visions
real.</p>

<p>We have seen how the new generation of web developers require
comprehensive high-level tools such as Spring Roo---not for
productivity but for learning best practices and scaffolding.  Our
experience so far indicates that it may in fact be possible to
continue with our methodology on a larger scale, developing scripts
and tools to support best practices in Spring Roo.  We also believe
experience with industry tools nicely compliments other academic first
year courses in Computer Science.</p></body></html>
