<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Javascript is now being used widely and because of this many Javascript
tools are being developed.</p>

<p>We present Escodegen and Esmangle. Escodegen is a code generator that
takes Mozilla JavaScript AST and converts into JavaScript code. Esmangle
is an optimizer and a minifier for Mozilla JavaScript AST.</p>

<p>By using Mozilla JavaScript AST as an intermediate representation (IR),
we can combine small tools that operate on AST into larger tools, such
as an ahead of time compiler. We can also add our own pass functions
that can be applied to the AST from the tools.</p>

<p>As the result, we can develop composable modules independently, reuse
them to create new tools, and keep each modules simple. And because of
well-documented IR, each module's interface can be standardized.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>JavaScript is a programming language usually executed in web pages, and
recently used on the server-side.</p>

<p>Many languages that transpile into Javascript have been developed, such
as <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>,
<a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript">ClojureScript</a> and
<a href="http://jsx.github.com/">JSX</a>. They define new syntax or otherwise
extend JavaScript to provide powerful features. However, transpiled
languages have a problem that they are difficult to debug since line and
column numbers of the output script do not correspond to the original.
If an error occurs, we cannot rely on the error's location information.</p>

<p>Because script size affects performance of a site, minifier tools have
also been developed. For example, we can use
<a href="https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS">UglifyJS</a>, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/">YUI
compressor</a> or <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/">Google
Closure Compiler</a>. They
parse JavaScript, trim white spaces, do optimization and shorten
variable names. They have the same debugging difficulties as transpilers.</p>

<p>The solution to this line mapping problem is
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit">SourceMap</a>,
which is a JSON file that holds location mapping information which is
lost in transformations. By using SourceMap, debuggers can associate an
executed script with an original script to provide line and column
numbers information to developers.
<a href="https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2">UglifyJS2</a> can generate SourceMap.</p>

<p>However, there is still a problem because current tools accept
JavaScript as text, but much information is discarded, such as location
information. For example, if you write code in CoffeeScript, compile it
to JavaScript code and dump it to minified script by minifier, location
information from the minified script to the original CoffeeScript code
is lost. UglifyJS2 saves SourceMap, but this mapping is from input
JavaScript text to output minified code. And so, the mapping from
CoffeeScript to non-minified JavaScript is lost.</p>

<p>To associate multi-level transformed scripts, SourceMap Multi-level
Mapping is now proposed as a part of SourceMap draft. But this is still
controversial.</p>

<p>As the result, current JavaScript tools tend to become all in one.
Transpilers do scanning, parsing, optimizing, minifying and generating
code. And minifiers do parsing, optimizing, minifying and generating
code. Because of this lack of modularization, if we construct transpiler
or other tools, it is necessary to create all above modules for our new
transpiler. And other debugging tools such as code coverage tool cannot
apply transpiled languages.</p>

<p>We present Escodegen and Esmangle. Escodegen is a code generator from
Mozilla JavaScript AST to JavaScript code. Esmangle is an optimizer and
a minifier for Mozilla JavaScript AST. They use Mozilla JavaScript AST
as an intermediate representation (IR). Because of this IR, we can pass
more information than text and we can therefore preserve location
information and solve the SourceMap multi-level mapping problem. Because
Mozilla JavaScript AST is a standardized interface, we can develop
modules independently, and combine them to develop larger tools.
Modules only rely on this IR, therefore if existing tools accept Mozilla JavaScript AST or generate it, we can use them with these modules.</p>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

<p>To construct well-modularized JavaScript tools, we use Mozilla
JavaScript AST as an intermediate representation. Mozilla JavaScript AST
is an AST representation of JavaScript, it is derived from SpiderMonkey's
internal AST. And it is available as a part of a reflection of the
SpiderMonkey parser. This format is well-documented at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SpiderMonkey/Parser_API">Parser API
document</a>.
Thanks to <a href="http://esprima.org/">Esprima</a>, the complete ECMAScript parser
written in ECMAScript, generating AST from JavaScript code is easy.
For example, "var a = 42" is represented as follows,</p>

<pre><code>{
    "type": "Program",
    "body": [{
        "type": "VariableDeclaration",
        "declarations": [{
            "type": "VariableDeclarator",
            "id": {
                "type": "Identifier",
                "name": "a"
            },
            "init": {
                "type": "Literal",
                "value": 42,
                "raw": "42"
            }
        }],
        "kind": "var"
    }]
}
</code></pre>

<p>By using this AST as an IR, we can develop each module independently to
accept AST and make them composable.</p>

<p>Regular compilers provide the result of control-flow analysis and data-flow analysis with IR such as SSA form.
But generating efficient JavaScript code from SSA form is hard because it contains arbitrary jumps.
Keep tracking of the JavaScript code's structure (such as an AST) with SSA form is one solution.
But it requires a module generate and keep a valid AST with SSA form, it is very difficult for each module.
This is because we use a simple AST as an IR.
By accepting an input AST, generating SSA form from it and getting it back to an AST, we can use SSA form in a module internally.</p>

<h3 id="escodegen">Escodegen</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Constellation/escodegen">Escodegen</a> is a JavaScript
code generator. It accepts AST and generates valid JavaScript. We can
use it like,</p>

<pre><code>escodegen.generate({
  type: 'BinaryExpression',
  operator: '+',
  left: { type: 'Literal', value: 40 },
  right: { type: 'Literal', value: 2 }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, Escodegen can accept location information attached to the
AST and generate a SourceMap from AST.
Escodegen's only job is to generate precise JavaScript code from AST. It
does not perform other tasks such as parsing and optimizing. But by
constructing optimized AST and passing it to Escodegen, we can get
optimized JavaScript code.</p>

<h3 id="esmangle">Esmangle</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Constellation/esmangle">Esmangle</a> is a JavaScript
minifier and optimizer.</p>

<p>Esmangle consists of many small pass functions, such as
remove-unused-label, tree-based-constant-folding.
A pass function's format is simple. It takes AST and some options,
performs optimizations on the AST and returns the optimized AST and a
flag to indicate whether or not the AST has been modified. We can
create custom Esmangle pass functions and add them to Esmangle's pipeline.
Esmangle's pass manager applies the provided pass functions to the AST.
It executes pass functions using fixed-point iteration over the AST.</p>

<p>22 pass functions are currently implemented. Most of them are small (100-200 lines). Some pass functions needs scope and variable information. It is provided by <a href="https://github.com/Constellation/escope">Escope</a> extracted from Esmangle. It is used to mangle names, analyze side effect, remove unused variables etc.</p>

<p>Esmangle has two phases, one for optimization and one for minification.
This is because some minification pass generates a less optimized AST. For example, a minification pass transforms "true" to "!0". In the optimization phase, a pass function transforms "!0" to "true".</p>

<p>While other minifiers accept JavaScript code text, Esmangle accepts
Mozilla JavaScript AST, Esmangle simply does optimization and
minification on Mozilla JavaScript AST and returns optimized AST.
Parsing and generating code are out of Esmangle's work, so we can keep
Esmangle well-modularized and simple. In addition to this modularization
benefit, because Esmangle preserve location information attached on AST,
which is lost if AST is transformed to text, we can get optimized AST
with location information to original script. If we pass it to
Escodegen, we can get correct SourceMap from an optimized code to an
original code, therefore we can solve multi-level SourceMap problem.</p>

<p>Currently Esmangle has no data-streams other than ASTs between pass functions. This is sufficient to perform simple optimization, but providing data-streams (such as SSA form), Esmangle can do more aggressive optimization.
However using only SSA form internally is not good because keep tracking of an AST with SSA form is hard. There are many passes that don't need complex analysis. So introducing SSA form into the pipeline partially is desirable.
In future work, we plan to construct a new big pass function using SSA form internally.
It consists of smaller pass functions treating an AST with SSA form.
A big pass function accepts an AST as an input and generates SSA form from it, executing smaller pass functions over the SSA form, and finally returning an AST by getting SSA form back to it.
As the result, we can introduce SSA form into the pipeline.</p>

<h3 id="constructingtoolsthroughmodules">Constructing tools through modules</h3>

<p>By using Mozilla JavaScript AST as an IR, these modules become simple
and composable, their interfaces become standardized, and we can pass
more information than text and combine JavaScript modules associated
with AST into large tools.</p>

<p>For example, Esmangle has an ahead of time JavaScript compiler, that
accepts JavaScript code, performs optimization and minification and
generates code or SourceMap.</p>

<p><img src="./escodegen-full_files/IxF6R.png" alt="Esmangle" title=""></p>

<p>In the above Ahead of Time (AOT) compiler, each module: parser,
optimizer, mangler and code generator are independent and sparsely
connected with an IR, Mozilla JavaScript AST.
So adding, removing, or replacing modules in the pipeline is trivial.
And we can reuse these modules and construct the new tools on the top of
them.</p>

<p>Modules are also used in the CoffeeScriptRedux compiler.</p>

<p><img src="./escodegen-full_files/AcLyL.png" alt="CoffeeScriptRedux" title=""></p>

<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/michaelficarra/CoffeeScriptRedux">CoffeeScriptRedux</a>
compiler uses Escodegen as its backend. It parses CoffeeScript code,
constructs CoffeeScript AST, transforms it to JavaScript AST and
generates JavaScript code by using Escodegen.
The use of using Esmangle in CoffeeScriptRedux is being
<a href="https://github.com/michaelficarra/CoffeeScriptRedux/issues/55">discussed</a>.</p>

<p>Another example is the <a href="https://github.com/yahoo/istanbul">istanbul</a>,
code coverage tool.</p>

<p><img src="./escodegen-full_files/viT1d.png" alt="Istanbul" title=""></p>

<p>This parses JavaScript by using Esprima, then transforming AST to trace
code execution and finally generating code by using Escodegen.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>We presented Escodegen and Esmangle, JavaScript modules using Mozilla
JavaScript AST as an intermediate representation.
By using it as an IR, we can develop JavaScript tool modules
independently, reuse them and combine them into large tools. This keeps
each module simple and composable, and makes their interfaces standardized.</p>

<p>In future work, we will make the code coverage tool store location
information in the AST.
Because the AST contains the location information of the original script,
this tool will be available for all transpiled
languages using Mozilla JavaScript AST as their IR. By constructing
these analysis tools on the top of JavaScript AST, they are available
for transpiled
languages other than JavaScript.</p>
