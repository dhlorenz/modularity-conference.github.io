<h2>AOAsia/Pacific<div class="sub">Monday 25th March 2013</div></h2>

<p>AOAsia/Pacific is a series of international workshops on advanced modularization techniques including aspect-oriented software development (AOSD). It was initially organized by Asia-related researchers in co-operation with researchers all over the world. Following the successes of the workshops on AOSD in 2005 (Taipei), 2006 (Tokyo), 2007 (Beijing), 2008 (Beijing), 2009 (Auckland), 2010 (Tokyo), and 2011 (Shanghai), the workshop organizers broadened the focus of the workshop from AOSD to advanced modularization techniques in general. The main goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers who are tackling the problems of advanced modularization, but who are not yet connected to this growing, thriving community. The workshop also intends to provide a forum for discussion of new ideas, new directions, and new applications.</p>

<h2>Modularity in Systems Software (MISS)<div class="sub">Monday 25th March 2013</div></h2>

<p>Developers of systems software such as operating systems, virtual machines, or middleware platforms are facing increasing demands from application programmers, who need higher-level support for application development. Meeting these demands requires careful use of software modularization techniques, since infrastructural concerns are notoriously hard to modularize and performance is a critical issue. Although high-level modularity constructs improve program understanding and productivity for developers, these constructs typically exhibit a significant performance impact, which is detrimental for the application programmers.</p>
<p>The MISS (Modularity in Systems Software) workshop series focuses on this trade-off for systems software modularity, but without limiting itself to aspects, components and patterns: MISS aims to be a highly interactive forum for researchers and developers to discuss the application, implementation and evaluation of any facet of modularity in low-level software. The ultimate goal is to develop a solid understanding of how modularity issues in such software can be addressed, and to thereby build connections between the software engineering and systems communities.</p>

<h2>Workshop on Comprehension of Complex Systems (CoCoS)<div class="sub">Monday 25th March 2013</div></h2>

<p>The sheer complexity and emergent behavior of large scale systems make it impossible to completely understand systems without the aid of specific tools. This is especially the case, as more and more systems start to use advanced compositions like Aspect-Orientation in their development. Advanced composition technologies enable the creation and usage of powerful abstractions; and improved modularity yields significant benefits in terms of reuse and separation of concerns. But by using abstractions, as they are present in languages, middlewares, and models, certain properties of a system are hidden (abstracted).</p>
<p>This creates the problem of comprehending the run-time behavior in terms of the used abstractions and the properties that were abstracted away (e.g. for debugging AO programs, or diagnosing violations of performance service-level agreements). To encourage wider adoption of advanced modularity, tools are required to assist developers in understanding the run-time behavior of complex composed systems. This workshop aims to create a dialog on the problem of program comprehension and its relation to modularity in the wider context.</p>

<h2>Software Infrastructure as a Crosscutting Concern:<br/>Vision for the Future (SIaCC)<div class="sub"><s>Monday 25th March 2013</s><font color="red">(Canceled)</font></div></h2>

<p>ICT is an infrastructure that is supporting an ever growing set of services. Software infrastructure tends to deeply crosscut other forms of infrastructure provision, and, gradually, replaces services that would previously have been delivered via other forms of infrastructure. For instance, the online shopping affecting retail shops, transportation, and need for road provision. Newly emerging technologies, such as food printing and personal fabrication go even further. This workshop aims to initiate a discussion on broad topics of software as a crosscutting infrastructure, envision the future with service provision centred around the software infrastructure, identify and discuss the current and future (both software engineering, and broader) issues that either facilitate or prevent this vision.</p>

<h2>Foundations of Aspect Oriented Languages (FOAL)<div class="sub">Tuesday 26th March 2013</div></h2>

<p>FOAL is a forum for research in foundations of aspect-oriented and other advanced separation of concern mechanisms. Areas of interest include but are not limited to: semantics, specification and verification for such languages, type systems, static analysis, theory of testing, theory of composition, and theory of program translation (compilation) and rewriting for advanced separation of concern mechanisms including aspect-oriented programming languages. The workshop aims to foster work in foundations, including formal studies, promote the exchange of ideas, and encourage workers in the semantics, types, and formal methods communities to do research in the area of aspect-oriented and other advanced separation of concern mechanisms.</p>

<h2>Green in Software Engineering, Green by Software Engineering (GIBSE)<div class="sub">Tuesday 26th March 2013</div></h2>

<p>The increasing amount of the energy consumption of today's IT solutions significantly contributes to green house gas emissions. "Green Computing" or "Green IT" emphasizes on the need for reducing the environmental impacts of IT solutions by reducing their energy consumption and, thus, greenhouse gas emissions. From the software engineering point of view, we believe that achieving green-ness in the software is an emerging quality attribute that must be taken into account throughout the software development process from the business-modeling phase till the operational phase. In addition, the effect of software steering or utilizing external devices is subject to "green-ness", too. Thus, this workshop is not just about "green in software", but also on "green by software". However, despite the inevitable need for considering green-ness throughout the software development process, there is a lack of scientific focus on this subject. The purpose of the proposed workshop is to fill this gap. Achieving green computing requires attention from both researchers in academia and industry. Therefore, in this track we aim at bridging the gap between academia and industry by emphasizing more on the application of scientific achievements in green computing in industrial software. The timeliness of this workshop is evident in the industrial application of green computing.</p>

<h2>Workshop on Variability and Composition (VariComp)<div class="sub">Tuesday 26th March 2013</div></h2>

<p>In applying multi-dimensional separation of concerns, the composition of carefully separated concerns is an important issue. The time at which concern composition is applied can vary depending on the concrete approach at hand. Advanced modularity techniques have extensively been used to enable variability in software product lines, where features are usually composed at build time. Likewise, run-time composition has been investigated, enabling dynamic aspect weaving, recomposition and reconfiguration.  Using context-oriented programming, dynamic feature variation is used to react to environmental changes and events in a way statically controlled by the programming language. This workshop investigates tools and techniques in support of the aforementioned composition stages, potential implementation and optimization approaches as well as formalization and verification techniques.</p>
